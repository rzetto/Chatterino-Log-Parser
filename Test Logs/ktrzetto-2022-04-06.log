[09:32:32]  laurabraus: feel better haine :(
[09:32:55]  laurabraus: trueeeeeee
[09:33:26]  haine_sense1: I mean, it's headache + excessive feelings from loneliness and watching you and not coping well when too tired
[09:33:35]  laurabraus: when i was in middle school playing the first galaxy game the death pits drove me to sell the game i kept dying so many times
[09:34:32]  laurabraus: real gamers ONLY
[09:35:06]  haine_sense1: it'll be fine lol
[09:35:32]  haine_sense1: sorry for saying awkward stuff again there
[09:35:49]  laurabraus: dude it was specifically sweet sweet galaxy. that shit was insane. but i beat is yesterday after all this time. a lot of yelling happened BUT I BEAT IT...MY NEMESIS
[09:36:15]  haine_sense1: @laurabraus sweet sweet galaxy's moving holes are soooo annoying
[09:36:22]  laurabraus: I KNOW...FUCK

[09:37:30]  laurabraus: im bad at gaming but im 10 years BETTER now
[09:37:54]  haine_sense1: woo woo
[09:38:02]  haine_sense1: not completely terrible

[09:38:32]  laurabraus: streams* dude my keyboard is breaking fr
[09:38:50]  laurabraus: exactly haine nobody can blame a literal kid for struggling
[09:38:51]  haine_sense1: I think I was probably like 15 when I got some European records on an obscure platforming game
[09:39:05]  haine_sense1: 2D platformer
[09:39:36]  laurabraus: LMAOOOOO
[09:39:45]  haine_sense1: nice bounce
[09:40:04]  haine_sense1: dunno if you've heard of Sayonara Umihara Kawase?
[09:41:16]  haine_sense1: fair, I just knew that it was much more known in Japan than Europe - hence the European records were kinda terrible compared to the Japanese ones
[09:41:33]  haine_sense1: which is why I was able to get some of them
[09:42:04]  haine_sense1: wait...
[09:42:08]  haine_sense1: I just saw a green star
