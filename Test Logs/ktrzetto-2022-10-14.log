[08:36:54]  kirosthegreat: I love parodies like this >.<
[08:38:00]  kirosthegreat: You will never look at trains the same way LUL

[09:02:51]  laurabraus: rip
[09:03:16]  chisasfam: zetto opinion on song lyrics
[09:03:38]  kirosthegreat: It's actually been a thing fr a long time. Written into the bible, if a woman's husband passes, then she "belongs" to her father, and if he's no longer around, ownership transfers to the brothers in order of oldest to youngest
[09:03:53]  shotmaker93: also correct
[09:04:11]  shotmaker93: i mean whatever to keep the reign and the bloodline

[09:16:49]  chisasfam: @Chisasfam good
[09:16:55]  chisasfam: why would you want to live in america
[09:17:02]  laurabraus: a lot of people translate manga for free as volunteers i think
[09:17:14]  laurabraus: unfortunately. but i think there are some official translation companies
[09:17:16]  chisasfam: hip and cool
[09:17:55]  laurabraus: they usually hire separate people for that thoug
[09:17:58]  laurabraus: h

[09:19:14]  dinosaurus: based
[09:19:28]  chisasfam: why dont you do fivver translations too?
[09:19:32]  dinosaurus: the majority of translators from what i have seen do it as a side gig
[09:19:38]  kaeos: you ALWAYS have options depending how shameless youre willing to be
[09:19:47]  laurabraus: you could definitely make a living translating hentai by commission
[09:19:59]  dinosaurus: yeah normie manga translators dont get commissioned at all cuz everyone reads fuckin onepiece
[09:20:12]  chisasfam: nice
[09:20:27]  dinosaurus: You think when you submit your CV for translations someone has to read all the hentai you translated to see your quality?
[09:20:42]  shotmaker93: ofc
[09:21:06]  shotmaker93: ain't nothing wrong with it
[09:21:09]  kaeos: oh i meant more along the lines of selling your body for money
[09:21:26]  dinosaurus: Madge normalize sex work

[09:23:54]  shotmaker93: yes
[09:24:04]  shotmaker93: for the right price i assume.
[09:24:29]  dinosaurus: ah I see
[09:24:34]  dinosaurus: so you cant be like "hey tip me enough here and ill get down with you"
[09:26:02]  shotmaker93: if you payed enough and the girl likes you, i think you can possibly hook up with her after her shift

[09:37:56]  laurabraus: yeah 2008 was when i tried
[09:38:10]  rinta_rnt: 俺の親が今ゴミ出しに行ったｗｗ
[09:38:16]  laurabraus: but my pc wasnt strong enough so  i never could. shes totally playing for a guy though
[09:38:24]  laurabraus: so i feel like she'll drop it soon
[09:38:44]  laurabraus: oh hell no im not paying
[09:39:22]  laurabraus: yeah you heard right. my niece is 19 and met a guy on tinder and he plays wizard 101
[09:39:26]  dinosaurus: toxic masculinity is over
[09:39:30]  dinosaurus: COD is dead
[09:39:34]  dinosaurus: wizard 101 reigns supreme
[09:39:40]  dinosaurus: girls play league for guys now
[09:39:44]  laurabraus: SAME
[09:39:47]  kaeos: league and valorant
[09:39:58]  chisasfam: cheese streamed it a while ago
[09:40:01]  laurabraus: i was shocked when she said it she was like "do you remember....wizard 101" i was like THATS the game you guys play?
[09:40:16]  laurabraus: @Dinosaurus so true i did this
[09:40:23]  dinosaurus: what role laura :)
[09:40:33]  laurabraus: i dont even remember i think i played as a tank

[09:40:50]  laurabraus: if i saw pics of the people i could tell you
[09:40:55]  dinosaurus: oh thats true its more valo than league
[09:41:04]  laurabraus: valo for SURE
[09:41:20]  dinosaurus: what a psychotic take
[09:41:21]  laurabraus: but you kind of have to be into valo already or the guy just wont be interested in you LOL
[09:41:27]  laurabraus: because itll ruin their RANK or whatever
[09:41:49]  dinosaurus: that makes more sense, the same fucked up brain of a league player would be a speedrunner if they didnt do team sports
[09:41:55]  kaeos: team sports are nice because theres always a way to offset blame of failure

[11:27:40]  303devilfish: You can say that I was born to be a Twitch channel mod. I catch a glimpse of copypasta, the adrenaline starts pumping. A whiff of drama, I snap into duty. My streamer calls for a chat ban, I erase that motherfucker from the history books of this channel. There is no !command I won’t code, no timeout I won’t give, no Twitch laws I won’t overlook, and no order I won’t obey to make my streamer happy. And if you become his problem, well, I’m sorry to say that I’ll become yours.
[11:28:20]  fujitoma: サブウェイに今から配達出来るよう問い合わせますね（過激）
[11:28:32]  kaeos: sounds like something an amouranth mod would type
