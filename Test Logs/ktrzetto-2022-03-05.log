[12:43:20]  laurabraus: the sugar coating is super fine
[12:43:39]  laurabraus: but enough that when you bite it you cronch on the little grains

[12:52:05]  rinta_rnt: HypeCherry
[12:53:06]  kirosthegreat: Think it's just something to differentiate themselves. But yeah, I've wondered about things like geometric and conceptual vtubers - why not a diamond vtuber or an algorithm vtuber
[12:54:03]  kirosthegreat: I haven't seen alien vtubers yet either.
[12:54:22]  kirosthegreat: Plenty of demon vtubers though
[12:55:26]  kirosthegreat: I only watch a few, but they always tend to raid other vtubers, so I still get exposed to a bunch
[12:56:01]  kirosthegreat: Never have to worry about makeup or messy hair though
[12:57:17]  kirosthegreat: I've been living on twitch for the past month while I've been limited to my laptop and can't really play games. Living vicariously watching ppl play games.
[12:58:29]  kirosthegreat: I feel that. I don't have my DS ;lkajgf;ajwrrsgw;inaeo;rign
[12:59:32]  kirosthegreat: On the plus side, I've discovered a bunch of neat people. Wouldn't have learned about you and usa if not for twitch.
