[11:58:45]  chisasfam: it masically means their cool
[11:58:48]  chisasfam: like my guy
[11:59:04]  chisasfam: Its not guy but it means their cool
[11:59:06]  sashimiyata: gangster

[12:00:31]  chisasfam: its what you use when someone has done something cool to essentially compliment them
[12:00:41]  chisasfam: like
[12:00:50]  chisasfam: man 1: what do you think of that zetto fella
[12:01:01]  chisasfam: man 2: ah man he is a proper g you know

[12:01:53]  chisasfam: my g
[12:02:01]  saltychildofthesea: isn't just gangster?
[12:02:12]  chisasfam: its a british term I think? idk
[12:02:14]  vptino17: but like no one means it like gangster, we aint gangsters out here
[12:02:15]  chisasfam: is it used else where

[12:03:01]  vptino17: !define g
[12:03:02]  nightbot: Term: 'g': A "G" doesn't necessarily refer to a gangster.  In Queens, among the individuals I'm [acquainted] with, a "G" is basically a person who has their "shit together"....or someone who is [good at life], all around.  An individual who is good looking, [in good shape], is intelligent, has money, is good with people, is with ho... http://g.urbanup.com/3078161
[12:03:02]  chisasfam: !define g

[12:10:06]  vptino17: if I remember correctly it was from like a french word that meant to warn like as an omen
[12:10:33]  vptino17: bc like when you saw ur animals all weird as shit it was like a warning something bad would happen
[12:10:38]  chisasfam: zetto
[12:10:43]  chisasfam: wtf are your tweets man
[12:11:08]  chisasfam: do you want a quote?

[12:11:35]  chisasfam: "everytime I fart on the couch my dog runs over and starts sniffing as hard as he can"
[12:12:05]  vptino17: three legs and he sniffs your fartas
[12:12:18]  chisasfam: your dog has some baggage
