[09:56:53]  chisasfam: it depends
[09:57:06]  chisasfam: no were a marketing compant
[09:57:10]  chisasfam: it depends on the client
[09:57:24]  chisasfam: bc sometimes we contact businesses on behalf of clients
[09:57:43]  chisasfam: and sometimes I manage their social media accounts for abit / give them advice
[09:58:36]  chisasfam: and occasionally
[09:58:43]  chisasfam: and I mean occasionally I do SEO
[09:58:48]  chisasfam: like search engine optimisation
[09:58:54]  chisasfam: I HATEEE SEO its so dumb
[09:59:14]  chisasfam: yes
[09:59:18]  chisasfam: use better tags ig
[09:59:31]  chisasfam: speedrun
[09:59:39]  chisasfam: pb attempts and wr attempts work for me
[09:59:46]  chisasfam: but they arent reliable
[10:00:04]  chisasfam: chad and japanese are good but for japanese you risk getting fetishisers
[10:00:13]  chisasfam: retro doesnt make sense
[10:00:17]  chisasfam: short makes sense you are small
[10:00:36]  chisasfam: tokyo is irellevent and seems like it would be saturated so it might not be worth having
[10:00:49]  chisasfam: title is okay could make it abit catchier ?
[10:01:06]  nightbot: Tip me here: https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip
[10:01:22]  laurabraus: if you're near tokyo i think it's relevanr
[10:01:26]  chisasfam: my titles were "16 stars to *something funny*" to hook ppl and it worked very well
[10:01:26]  laurabraus: relevant*
[10:01:33]  chisasfam: yeah if he is in tokyo
[10:01:45]  chisasfam: like i did "16 stars to stop me from crying alone at night"
[10:01:50]  chisasfam: and ppl seemed to like those titles
[10:02:01]  laurabraus: i like your vague life update titles though
[10:02:01]  chisasfam: but titles and tags can only get you so far
[10:02:16]  chisasfam: ofc you need ppl chatting they do more for you
[10:02:32]  chisasfam: yes they are v niche to this community and I like them too :))
[10:02:53]  laurabraus: listen i majored in public relations and social media and stuff and let me tell you the secret to gaining traction is........luck
[10:03:03]  chisasfam: can you put tags on a channel and not just a stream?
[10:03:06]  chisasfam: bc you can on yt
[10:03:11]  chisasfam: @laurabraus literally
[10:03:18]  chisasfam: you need to be algorithm friendly
[10:03:32]  chisasfam: try PB Attempts
[10:03:39]  chisasfam: its all about testing the waters
[10:03:47]  chisasfam: if these work for you then they work ofc
[10:08:57]  chisasfam: opinion on among us boobs?
[10:08:57]  laurabraus: i mean if you enjoy what you're doing keep doing it. i like knowing what to expect. but you could also start playing valorant or something and get 1k viewers
[10:09:10]  chisasfam: yeah yeah]
[10:09:18]  chisasfam: hmmm
[10:09:20]  chisasfam: i mean
[10:09:23]  laurabraus: you wouldnt even want that many viewers
[10:09:35]  chisasfam: with the time you stream at , cheese and simply ususally end in abit
[10:09:52]  chisasfam: so you have a chance of being raided by them bc they have been raiding smaller mario streamers
[10:10:31]  laurabraus: yeah thats another aspect. being a presence in other circles
[10:10:55]  chisasfam: yeah collab
[10:11:08]  chisasfam: zetto im getting a switch we can play maro kart <3
[10:11:09]  laurabraus: what do you mean?
[10:11:21]  laurabraus: you are all nerds and game
[10:11:54]  laurabraus: i think sadly its hard to reach out online just to be friends because any form of interaction has started to be considered creepy
[10:12:00]  chisasfam: me and zetto mario collab
[10:12:03]  laurabraus: like "why r u talking to me"
[10:12:06]  rinta_rnt: MarioKartWii rdy

[10:12:33]  laurabraus: rinta and zetto mario kart wii stream
[10:12:45]  laurabraus: so true!!
[10:12:51]  chisasfam: people are just more reserved online now :(
[10:12:58]  laurabraus: maybe its just because we were younger
[10:13:10]  laurabraus: thats true. the internet has become more of a formal place
[10:13:59]  chisasfam: speakinging in the nihongo
[10:14:33]  chisasfam: We could be besties zetto but you keep turning down my advances
[10:15:06]  rinta_rnt: マイクラでどっか適当な鯖入れば
[10:15:24]  laurabraus: i totally agree
[10:15:45]  laurabraus: i really only watch your streams these days bc every other stream feels really. i don't want to say "unwelcoming"
[10:15:49]  chisasfam: look
[10:15:55]  chisasfam: zetto lets be friend and stream together
[10:16:36]  chisasfam: SEE

[10:21:54]  rinta_rnt: 普通のromで2人でプレイとか選べば
[10:22:19]  rinta_rnt: オフラインの2人だからCPU入れられる
[10:24:34]  laurabraus: is that video you were referencing the "is she into you?" one?
[10:27:55]  laurabraus: i feel like i'm the opposite of that video. because i always have constant anxiety that guys DO like me. because i always feel like they SHOULD be doubting more LMAO
[10:28:38]  chisasfam: You see , Im currently talking with this girl and were both flirting with eachother and we vibe rly well, but Idk if she actually likes me or not
[10:28:49]  laurabraus: i do feel for guys because often they're expected to make the first move. and that just sounds really anxiety inducing
[10:29:14]  laurabraus: especially because i always reject guys moves. i feel bad its not their fault for trying
[10:30:42]  chisasfam: im scared of regection
[10:30:45]  chisasfam: rejection*
[10:30:52]  chisasfam: so like the girl could be givng me all the signs
[10:31:04]  chisasfam: and I wont persue bc im scared of looking silly if she says no
[10:31:14]  chisasfam: personal experience?
[10:31:17]  laurabraus: i would never do that i would just lie
[10:31:20]  chisasfam: If she says no you could just go
[10:31:24]  chisasfam: ahah i was just joking!
[10:31:27]  chisasfam: it was just a goof!!
[10:31:34]  laurabraus: i'd be like oh sorry i have something to do that day. and they'd be like so another day? and then i cut all contact
[10:33:16]  laurabraus: @Chisasfam i did do this one time LMAO
[10:33:37]  chisasfam: id buy it
[10:33:42]  chisasfam: @Chisasfam see!!

[10:33:52]  chisasfam: and it rly hurt
[10:34:00]  chisasfam: has it worked for you?
[10:34:02]  laurabraus: i asked my guy friend out and he was like oh i have a girlfriend didn't you know? and i was like aha no i didn't! it was just a passing thought to ask you! haha sorry! i liked him for two years in reality
[10:34:03]  chisasfam: have you tried it>
[10:34:15]  chisasfam: bc if you havent tried it you cant comment on the technique
