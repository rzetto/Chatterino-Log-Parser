[12:27:22]  maxifyer: You're talking about radicals, right?
[12:28:05]  maxifyer: Would you say it's important to remember the stroke order exactly for every kanji?
[12:28:35]  maxifyer: Cause I mean, it is quite natural to forget sometimes
[12:28:52]  maxifyer: Ohh, that looks good!
[12:30:32]  maxifyer: You're right. It's like spelling. No one cares. Just look at internet chats LUL
[12:31:50]  maxifyer: I also find that if I write the kanji on paper a few times when I'm learning it, it sticks better
[12:33:13]  maxifyer: To my memory I mean

[12:52:51]  princedevvy: Let me introduce you to my buddy Elon. prince812Sip
[12:53:01]  princedevvy: I believe he has the same goal. But also has the money to make it happen.
[12:53:41]  princedevvy: Such a scale already exists. Google at your own discretion.
[12:53:49]  maxifyer: I'd say 2
[12:54:02]  maxifyer: Just the ears and the tail. And the behaviour
[12:54:03]  princedevvy: I think on that scale from 1-10, a 2 is a girl in a cat-ear headband
[12:55:07]  princedevvy: Ok I have to go get ready for suffering in GTFO. Best of luck you dat PB prince812Swag Here's another penny Cheer1
[12:58:07]  maxifyer: When I have a girlfriend, I will have her wear cat ears, a cat tail and cat paws. And then I will have her crawl around in my apartment and say "Nya, nya!" And then I'd give her fish and milk. Yes I'm weird LUL
[13:00:00]  maxifyer: And then I'll play with her with one of those cat toys that you wave in front of her and she's supposed to try and catch it!
[13:00:53]  maxifyer: It's just funny to see you react LUL
[13:01:30]  maxifyer: I see it as more of a cute thing than a fetish though
[13:01:49]  maxifyer: LUL
[13:02:56]  maxifyer: To be serious though. I'm a little scared. I have a test in 10 hours
[13:03:10]  maxifyer: And the last test I failed miserably :(
[13:03:12]  usausachu: Hey what‚Äôs your wordle today

[13:06:54]  maxifyer: I need to study as well!
[13:06:58]  maxifyer: So I can't sleep!
[13:07:17]  maxifyer: I'll study later. The test is in 10 hours
[13:07:43]  maxifyer: And the test is 5 hours long!
[13:08:40]  maxifyer: Ok, to be more precise. It's 4 hours but with a one hours break in the middle
[13:09:06]  maxifyer: No. It's just a math test LUL
[13:12:52]  maxifyer: It's not an ordinary high school. It's the Swedish equivalent of a night school. Aka, adults go there to finish their hs diploma if they didn't graduate
[13:12:56]  maxifyer: You have to apply for every course
[13:13:27]  dvsblack: wtf your english is like native
[13:13:28]  maxifyer: And this is gonna be the final test for the course I'm currently studying
[13:13:51]  dvsblack: and lived abroad?
[13:14:17]  dvsblack: ok, that makes more sense
[13:14:20]  dvsblack: still very good
[13:14:37]  dvsblack: some people live abroad for ten years and still have a thick accent
[13:14:40]  maxifyer: But honestly, I'm afraid I'm going to fail that test
[13:14:46]  maxifyer: I hope not honestly
[13:14:54]  dvsblack: you sound like you could have been born and raised in america
[13:14:58]  dvsblack: cant tell any difference
[13:15:59]  maxifyer: I also have a Swedish accent and yet I do my best to sound native LUL
[13:16:32]  dvsblack: ive always thought mimicing was the way to go
[13:17:18]  dvsblack: i should repeat people in conversation
[13:17:40]  maxifyer: I mostly learned English fluently just from playinv videl games a lot LUL
[13:17:50]  maxifyer: But I still don't sound native accet-wise
[13:18:13]  dvsblack: you know how they say something like idk.... "i bought a new car"
[13:18:20]  dvsblack: then I can repeat it as a question
[13:18:27]  dvsblack: "you bought a new car?
[13:18:51]  dvsblack: yeah probably
[13:18:57]  dvsblack: japanese is one of the easiest i think idk
[13:19:21]  dvsblack: that way im mimicing them
[13:19:27]  maxifyer: How can Mario be Italian when he is in a fantasy world?
[13:19:47]  dvsblack: the pronunciation doesnt really change per letter ya
[13:19:57]  dvsblack: sometimes you have tonal and emphasis yeah
[13:20:17]  dvsblack: like i know there is "A-me" and "a-ME"
[13:20:39]  dvsblack: „ÅÇ„ÇÅ
[13:20:52]  maxifyer: I remember Mario's voice actor saying that when he was in casting, they told him to act like an Italian plumber who's name is Mario
[13:21:20]  dvsblack: is it quite a bit? i havent noticed yet
[13:21:28]  dvsblack: „Åß„ÇÇ „Åæ„Å† „Åπ„Çì„Åç„Çá„ÅÜ„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã
[13:21:53]  maxifyer: LUL
[13:22:03]  dvsblack: i know exactly how all italian plumbers talk and act
[13:22:09]  dvsblack: thanks to mario
[13:24:10]  dvsblack: yes ive seen that a ton
[13:24:49]  dvsblack: im trying to think of examples...
[13:24:54]  maxifyer: I wonder if there is an italian guy who's name is Mario who decided to become a plumber for the memes LUL
[13:25:01]  dvsblack: oh umm

[13:31:09]  laurabraus: yeah
[13:31:37]  laurabraus: THATS WHAT WE WANNA KNOW!!!
[13:31:49]  laurabraus: he is definitely the most hated bachelor so far and the bar was low
[13:32:06]  laurabraus: the guys from his season were great and they chose him and nobody understood why
[13:32:10]  dvsblack: if you're talking about a show they probably did
[13:32:37]  laurabraus: so people were like well maybe if we know more about him he'll be okay but instead hes just proven how terrible he is repeatedly
[13:33:22]  laurabraus: bachelors and bachelorettes are chosen from past seasons contestants for the opposite show. so he was chosen from a group of guys that were trying to date the bachelorette last season
[13:33:35]  dvsblack: if i have to take home actual work to my home can i call that „Åó„ÇÖ„Åè„Å†„ÅÑÔºü  does anyone know?

[13:52:48]  maxifyer: Ok, but if I have my twitch stream open in my browser while logged in while livestreaming, does it count in myself?
[13:53:08]  usausachu: @maxifyer ye 1 viewer means it‚Äôs yourself
[13:53:17]  usausachu: Everyone always has 1 viewer
[13:53:55]  haine_sense1: oh, so when I'm in a 2 viewer stream it's just me?
[13:54:01]  musicelliott: Santa Claus is always watching us
[13:54:06]  haine_sense1: (and the streamer)
[13:55:32]  haine_sense1: sounded like a suggestion that Santa's the 1 viewer
[13:55:37]  musicelliott: That counts as a viewer
[13:56:59]  haine_sense1: he works in companies that make all the food people leave for him to help them make it better

[14:00:35]  roboplodicus: they get mixed together sometimes too right?
[14:02:12]  haine_sense1: yea, I kinda wondered if it was more of a cultural thing rather than particular religious belief or whatever
[14:02:48]  haine_sense1: I would guess shrine for shinto?

[14:32:38]  maxifyer: @Haine_Sense1 I dunno know what you mean. There are various ways to solve systems of equations. You can solve them with graphs, with the addition method or substitution method etc
[14:32:42]  robertzarmy: the longer I can go without calculus the better
[14:32:45]  robertzarmy: math is a blight on humanity

[15:02:51]  rosynyan: rosynyUv
[15:03:57]  roboplodicus: I tweeted the values for the green one at you
[15:04:05]  roboplodicus: they are even better
[15:04:07]  pulsejp: Press 1 if he didn‚Äôt wash his hands
[15:04:09]  pulsejp: 1
[15:04:14]  rosynyan: 1
[15:04:14]  roboplodicus: they are a pain in the ass to make though
[15:04:35]  usausachu: Sticky hands
[15:04:41]  pulsejp: WutFace
[15:04:56]  roboplodicus: just doing it for myself right now but I might sell them to atleast one person
[15:05:04]  pulsejp: My streamer pisses on his hands WutFace
[15:05:12]  rosynyan: btw I read a hentai the other day and the dude stayed with a mask on the whole time and I was like "LOL it's zetto"
[15:05:23]  usausachu: Have you seen that clip where the streamer forgot to mute when he went to pee
[15:05:30]  rosynyan: rosynyOwo
[15:06:17]  rosynyan: have you seen that streamer that forgot to move the cam when he peed
[15:06:17]  usausachu: Wait
[15:06:19]  usausachu: Really????
[15:06:21]  usausachu: And no
[15:06:24]  pulsejp: 12.9
[15:06:27]  rosynyan: LOL
[15:06:30]  pulsejp: Smh
[15:06:49]  pulsejp: Wait monkaW
[15:07:11]  roboplodicus: whats time consuming is you have to cut the whole gate out a game cube controller with an electric file and then shave the board down , you also have to have a usb programmer, program a microchip, then solder and hot glue everything together
[15:07:13]  rosynyan: bullying pulse is fun ngl
[15:07:20]  usausachu: https://youtu.be/r2QppbBI_qM
[15:07:28]  pulsejp: pjpBlush
[15:07:35]  rosynyan: oh no he likes it
[15:07:47]  roboplodicus: I think it took me about 4 hours to do today but I had already cut the gamecube stick out of the gamecube controller and that would have taken like 45 min
[15:07:50]  pulsejp: ktrzetWorse
[15:08:01]  usausachu: clintNo
[15:08:13]  rosynyan: pulse likes being stepped on
[15:08:15]  roboplodicus: I bet I could make one in like 3.5 hours with the experience I have
[15:08:20]  rosynyan: pjpStep
[15:08:29]  roboplodicus: maybe only 3
[15:09:13]  pulsejp: Don‚Äôt we all pjpTasty
[15:09:14]  roboplodicus: it only costs you a gamecube controller the micro chips are like 50 cents a piece
[15:09:31]  roboplodicus: I've made like 6 of them I think
[15:09:53]  rosynyan: @PulseJP I like stepping on people does that count?
[15:09:59]  roboplodicus: they last forever though since the gamecube stick last forever those things never wear out
[15:10:32]  pulsejp: pjpStep
[15:11:37]  pulsejp: My melee controller is crazy bad
[15:11:43]  usausachu: L B L J
[15:11:45]  pulsejp: But they‚Äôre durable AF
[15:12:14]  usausachu: Oh really? Why
[15:12:17]  rosynyan: Usa I just saw the clip usausaShake
[15:12:18]  notmango: LBJs
[15:12:22]  notmango: :)
[15:12:35]  usausachu: @rosynyan which one. My clip? Or a clip I made of zetto 0.0
[15:12:36]  notmango: IIM SUPER HARD
[15:12:40]  notmango: IM BRICKED UP
[15:12:44]  rosynyan: the guy peeing
[15:12:49]  usausachu: Ohhhh ye
[15:12:57]  rosynyan: usausaCry
[15:13:00]  usausachu: His chat loses it usausaShake
[15:13:25]  rosynyan: listen, I can appreciate a good piss flaw
[15:13:28]  maxifyer: I'm back. Taking a small break. I was just studying online and I got all rights so far!
[15:13:30]  roboplodicus: you can use a thrashed n64 controller so really like 40$ plus labour which I figure would cost 15$ an hour so thats like 100$ so I'd have to sell them for more than that depending on the profit margin I wanted
[15:13:30]  rosynyan: intimidating
[15:13:33]  maxifyer: I really hope the test till go well
[15:13:35]  roboplodicus: LBJ is a US president
[15:13:35]  nightbot: IT'S NOT AN LBJ https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxaCjvrDmKVP7VDh52OHHTciChI-l9VL6O
[15:15:05]  roboplodicus: most of the extra time I spent today was figuring out the programming shit and trying to remember wtf I did when I built one last time
[15:16:30]  roboplodicus: the only thing is the code that runs on the micro chip is technically supposed to not be for profit but the guy that wrote it lives in germany and I'm not mass producing them so I'd be fine
[15:16:58]  roboplodicus: I actually didn't write the code but setting up the programmer was hard
[15:17:36]  roboplodicus: its all set up now though I thought about offering them to speed runners I'm genuinely curious if they are actually decent
[15:18:08]  roboplodicus: they feel just like a gamecube controller but have the right button layout for the n64
[15:18:42]  roboplodicus: I'm a pretty big scrub I have a 27 right now
[15:19:10]  roboplodicus: I've only been running for like 2 months though
[15:19:19]  roboplodicus: I built the first one for smash 64
[15:20:06]  roboplodicus: thats a good idea to post it in the sm64 discord
[15:20:08]  roboplodicus: I might do that
[15:20:43]  roboplodicus: I actually have a really good condition OEM controller that I don't use since I like these better
[15:21:22]  roboplodicus: do you grease the sticks?
[15:21:28]  roboplodicus: that makes them last like twice as long
[15:22:19]  roboplodicus: damn they cost like 30$ here video game stuff is so cheap in japan I don't understand why
[15:22:55]  roboplodicus: is retro gaming less of a thing?
[15:23:02]  roboplodicus: like no one throws stuff out?
[15:23:35]  roboplodicus: collecting is silly imo fight me
[15:24:06]  roboplodicus: ya collecting has made some games pretty expensive like conker's bad fur is over 100$ right now
[15:25:02]  roboplodicus: I sell my old stuff too my only consoles are a n64, wii and xbox 360
[15:25:08]  roboplodicus: used to have a bunch of different ones
[15:28:23]  roboplodicus: have you spent much time speed running 16 stars?
[15:33:52]  roboplodicus: did you go to school in the bay area or just live there and work?
[15:34:46]  roboplodicus: I love the bay I went to school at berkeley for 3 years
[15:37:02]  roboplodicus: what part of the sm64 discord do people sell stuff in?
[15:37:11]  rosynyan: otsu bro
