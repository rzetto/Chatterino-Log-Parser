[15:19:27]  roboplodicus: kind of curious about star names
[15:19:59]  chef_zack: star names are probably very similar

[15:35:38]  roboplodicus: it was in england I think
[15:37:28]  roboplodicus: I swear the stars are a slightly different color in the j version compared to the U version
[15:38:03]  roboplodicus: thats why dildos have balls attatched to them sometimes its a safety feature
[15:39:16]  roboplodicus: I've actually owned a j cartridge before and they looked differnte then too
[15:41:08]  roboplodicus: actually probably not but in practice it is a safety feature
