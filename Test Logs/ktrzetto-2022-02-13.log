[15:21:37]  robertzarmy: I'm aiming to hit N5 after my first full year
[15:21:46]  robertzarmy: u can do it in like 2 months tho its nuts
[15:22:02]  maxifyer: That didn't make me feel much better LUL
[15:22:19]  robertzarmy: how do u even test for N5 without paying for a test
[15:22:24]  robertzarmy: just pass a practice test?
[15:22:48]  robertzarmy: no shot I pay for N5
[15:22:56]  robertzarmy: anything below N3 is not worth paying for
[15:23:02]  robertzarmy: its useless
[15:23:11]  maxifyer: Do you know anyone who took the Daiken test? Is it looked down upon in Japan?
[15:23:31]  robertzarmy: nah like N3 is the minimum you need for jobs to recognize it
[15:23:36]  robertzarmy: below that and jobd dont care
[15:23:47]  maxifyer: Daiken, is like the Japanese version of GED (but you probably don't know what that is either LUL )
[15:24:46]  robertzarmy: pretty much
[15:24:53]  maxifyer: Yes. I'm not American but from my understanding, it's the equivalent of a HS diploma. It's a test you take after dropping out of HS
[15:25:16]  rosynyan: who cares about HS diploma though LUL
[15:26:00]  maxifyer: The reason I'm asking though is because Japan is a country that cares a lot about grades and doing well in school and such. It's highly valued there
[15:26:07]  rosynyan: like these days people want you to have a degree
[15:29:19]  rosynyan: you should take a break LUL
