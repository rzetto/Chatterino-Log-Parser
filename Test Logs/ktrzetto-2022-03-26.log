[12:44:39]  laurabraus: its neither of those words
[12:44:59]  robertzarmy: on that note actually
[12:45:09]  robertzarmy: are ひらく and あく different
[12:45:20]  robertzarmy: GG
[12:46:09]  robertzarmy: the dictionary states both as intransitive in that scenario though
[12:46:47]  robertzarmy: oh it says hiraku is both transitive and intransitive
[12:47:20]  robertzarmy: thoughts laura?
[12:48:02]  robertzarmy: i tried to get laura to start learning you know
[12:48:04]  robertzarmy: she wanted to
[12:48:05]  laurabraus: what are we talking about
[12:48:07]  robertzarmy: but she just quits
[12:48:35]  laurabraus: yeah hes just calling me out because i havent even started studying
[12:48:49]  laurabraus: i cant quit when i dont even start
[12:48:58]  robertzarmy: bro she said she wants to
[12:49:01]  robertzarmy: i tried to coax her
[12:49:04]  laurabraus: i do want to
[12:49:20]  laurabraus: i even started learning before meeting yall thats how i knew all those resources
[12:49:54]  robertzarmy: learning japanese just has a really high barrier to entry
[12:49:56]  laurabraus: im just bad at motivating myself
[12:50:03]  robertzarmy: cause you gotta learn how to read it first
[12:50:58]  robertzarmy: for the most part grammar is pretty easy yeah
[12:51:07]  robertzarmy: especially formally
[12:52:49]  robertzarmy: i got lucky cause i wanted to start and motivation carried long enough to make it a habit
[12:53:22]  robertzarmy: katakana is more fucked up than kanji
[12:54:22]  robertzarmy: everybody wants to help the japanese guy learn english, nobody wants to help the english guy learn japanese
[12:54:58]  robertzarmy: bro imagine if you were a girl trying to learn english
[12:54:59]  laurabraus: @robertzarmy i agree with this
[12:55:08]  robertzarmy: youd have people lined out your doorstep
[12:55:15]  laurabraus: true
[12:55:50]  laurabraus: i see it on hellotalk which is this language exchange app i sometimes use. so many american dudes trying to talk to all the girls
[12:56:27]  robertzarmy: literally the extent of actual japanese conversation i get is when i sometimes talk to rinta in discord
[12:57:14]  robertzarmy: I NEED A STUDY PARTNER
[12:57:22]  robertzarmy: I WOULD BE FUCKING N3
[12:57:30]  laurabraus: yeah and they try so hard to be like "THIS ISNT A DATING APP" then i saw an ad of theirs and it was like "i met my foreign husband on hellotalk!!"like you're sending mixed messages
[13:00:02]  robertzarmy: putin secretly told me he only invaded because laura didnt start studying JP
[13:00:55]  laurabraus: wow that is a lot to put on my shoulders rob
[13:01:10]  robertzarmy: it's all your fault
[13:01:14]  laurabraus: all because i cant get my shit together to take my online lesson.
[13:01:32]  robertzarmy: wait u get lessons and everything
[13:01:36]  robertzarmy: and u still cant start

[13:02:55]  robertzarmy: ok zetto is 26 i figured it out
[13:02:55]  laurabraus: but that is impressive
[13:03:18]  robertzarmy: because of how fast you knew it
[13:03:22]  laurabraus: i definitely had this weird feeling you were 27 but i forget what the reason was
[13:03:23]  robertzarmy: it must have come out on your birth year
[13:03:32]  robertzarmy: and thats how you know it so easy
[13:03:37]  robertzarmy: cause its your age
[13:03:37]  chef_zack: robert i know sm64's age and i am not 26
[13:03:43]  chef_zack: its called being a massive nintendo nerd
[13:04:03]  robertzarmy: zetto is 26
