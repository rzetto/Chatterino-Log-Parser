[09:00:05] ktrZetto is live!
[09:02:11]  streamelements: ktrZetto is now live! Streaming Super Mario World: JP&ENG | JP&ENG | Blind Playthrough
[09:06:55]  303devilfish: he has to be trolling FailFish
[09:08:53]  303devilfish: FailFish
[09:15:04]  laurabraus: whats up
[09:15:07]  kirosthegreat: Really showing off that high IQ, son Kappa
[09:16:21]  kirosthegreat: A misunderstood genius YEP
[09:17:18]  kaeos: why dont you play real games like rinta does
[09:17:46]  kaeos: apex
[09:17:53]  kirosthegreat: The cape straight up said "bruh" right before you fell usausaTanties
[09:18:06]  laurabraus: wow
[09:18:07]  kaeos: i watched him for 10 minutes but he doesnt speak a real language and there were 3 of them and i couldnt understand any of them
[09:19:04]  kirosthegreat: Eating ham borgir rikkuNom ogurlzLurk
[09:19:14]  kaeos: he's still a better streamer than u
[09:19:20]  laurabraus: i said wow bc you died not bc of apex
[09:20:32]  303devilfish: FailFish
[09:21:13]  kaeos: alt + f4
[09:21:40]  laurabraus: left and right trigger
[09:21:51]  303devilfish: you have to be riding yoshi
[09:21:58]  laurabraus: wait wait. it literally said how earlier
[09:22:35]  kaeos: PepeLaugh
[09:23:40]  laurabraus: yeah its left and right trigger buttons on SOME levels it says
[09:24:08]  kaeos: what does it mean when they say "throw it back"? (im a visual learner btw)
[09:24:34]  303devilfish: just fly above the stage
[09:24:48]  kaeos: wings of redemption
[09:24:53]  laurabraus: looking that up rn
[09:24:58]  303devilfish: just press left every second or so
[09:25:10]  laurabraus: the wings are also a yoshi thing
[09:25:21]  303devilfish: press it sooner
[09:25:29]  kaeos: this is a legitimate skill issue
[09:25:34]  303devilfish: yes
[09:25:48]  303devilfish: as long as mario's facing downward you can press left and he'll go up again
[09:25:49]  laurabraus: you have to be riding yoshi but when you are, the wings teleport you to a bonus area filled with dragon coins
[09:26:14]  303devilfish: pretty sure it's the only way
[09:26:44]  kaeos: when are you collabing with rinta
[09:26:57]  kaeos: no
[09:27:13]  kaeos: play apex with him
[09:27:15]  303devilfish: oh yeah i guess you could jump off yoshi, that works too
[09:28:08]  kaeos: the gun you use doesnt matter if you just never miss
[09:28:24]  303devilfish: PepePls
[09:28:28]  laurabraus: oh yeah also you can fly
[09:28:31]  kaeos: StinkyCheese
[09:28:43]  303devilfish: fuzzies
[09:29:14]  laurabraus: but now you can just fly through the end
[09:29:17]  laurabraus: i think
[09:29:19]  303devilfish: PepeLaugh here it comes
[09:29:30]  laurabraus: wait maybe not do you not have wings anymore
[09:29:43]  laurabraus: why is he still blue then wtf
[09:30:36]  303devilfish: OMEGALUL
[09:30:38]  kaeos: ?
[09:31:20]  kaeos: if a snake bit your homie on the dick would you suck out the venom for him
[09:31:38]  kaeos: yes
[09:31:45]  kaeos: actually no you just felt like it
[09:31:54]  iop4everdudes: yo zetto, hope you're doing good man. how you liking Mario world now that you're a bit further?(i see you found star world and got blue yoshi!)
[09:31:55]  303devilfish: FeelsWeirdMan
[09:32:31]  kaeos: i feel like this would be easier without yoshi
[09:32:35]  iop4everdudes: oh shit sorry for the spoilers. i just saw blue yoshi and assumed star world
[09:32:46]  303devilfish: just fly lmao
[09:33:30]  kaeos: LUL
[09:34:07]  kaeos: cheese would have done it already
[09:34:55]  iop4everdudes: bruh can do extremely difficult spin jump chains(i have a large playtime and couldn't do what he just did) but can't do basic flying (just tap back every second) LUL
[09:35:15]  303devilfish: u literally just press left on a rhythm
[09:35:23]  kaeos: put on a metronome
[09:35:46]  laurabraus: but youre so good at rhythm games
[09:36:09]  iop4everdudes: tap backwards right as you begin falling down.... thats it..... as you do it more, it becomes second nature. I'm a fucking stupid teen, if i can do it you definitely can
[09:36:10]  kaeos: you should do a camping stream
[09:36:44]  vptino17: "blind playthrough" but your eyes are clearly visible
[09:36:51]  vptino17: DansGame
[09:37:20]  kaeos: ok ?
[09:38:17]  iop4everdudes: now i love sm64, its one of my favourite games of all time. but the flying in 64 ain't got nothing on SMW. flying in 64 is meh, flying in world is so comfortable AND technical, you can actually get good at it. 64 flying is like the worst part of the game
[09:38:17]  303devilfish: PepeLaugh
[09:38:23]  kaeos: is that a ballsack on your shirt
[09:38:58]  kaeos: oh is it a skunk
[09:40:10]  iop4everdudes: flying in smb3 is cool(if you don't know, you just infinitely mash jump and can fly forever with the tanooki suit)
[09:40:23]  kaeos: i want nothing more than for you to be successful
[09:41:56]  iop4everdudes: mario 3 has better control of mario than world. world is better in every other way though, music, art, level design. 3's control of mario is so much nicer, more floaty and not HYPER RESPONSIVE to a millisecond of holding a direction
[09:42:25]  kaeos: my favorite is mario bros DS widepeepoHappy
[09:42:59]  303devilfish: u literally just need to press left more often
[09:43:30]  iop4everdudes: @ktrzetto just go to the first level, and practice flight ON SCREEN to get a feel for it. makes the flying without sight/visual aid easy as fuck and feel more natural
[09:43:30]  kaeos: turn on a metronome
[09:43:40]  kaeos: some people are just rhythmically impaired
[09:44:21]  kaeos: in what way are you impaired then?
[09:44:41]  iop4everdudes: man doesn't wanna practice, and wonders why this thing is hard for him Kappa . imagine a new sm64 player randomly triple jumps at a cage and hopes to do owless. like bruh
[09:46:00]  kaeos: if youre anything like me, you could just watch a playthrough of someone else doing it and get the same satisfaction with none of the effort
[09:47:17]  iop4everdudes: watching your 'lets play' inspired me to play this game again. I'm pretty sure once i get sub 2 in 120, I'll do 96 exits for a bit
[09:48:01]  kaeos: whats your time in 120
[09:48:11]  kaeos: L
[09:48:29]  kaeos: op has a better time than u thats all i need to know
[09:48:47]  scratchatk: PokPikachu yoo
[09:49:11]  laurabraus: have you completed this main game yet
[09:49:15]  kaeos: game over x6
[09:49:33]  iop4everdudes: i feel like if i got a somewhat respectable time in sm64, and also did decent in world, i could get more players to try world(i think world is really underrated in a speedrun sense, only popular in japan, and even then not that popular)
[09:49:39]  laurabraus: dude just complete the main game and then you'll get a bunch of practice flying
[09:50:00]  laurabraus: wtf
[09:50:12]  kaeos: no
[09:50:30]  kaeos: unless ur actually good at it
[09:50:32]  kaeos: its painful now
[09:50:38]  laurabraus: yeah
[09:50:46]  303devilfish: i do :)
[09:50:52]  kaeos: maybe not you
[09:51:05]  kaeos: no gamer genes looking ass
[09:51:53]  iop4everdudes: i gotta be up in 6 hours, so I'll see you guys next time. have a good day guys, and we believe in you zetto, you got this! PotFriend
[09:52:00]  laurabraus: @iop4everdudes goodnightttt
