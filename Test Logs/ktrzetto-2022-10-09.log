[08:46:53]  chisasfam: think*
[08:47:20]  chisasfam: anyway, this new ranked system makes it so you have to do 10 placement matches to determine your starting rank for the season

[09:08:52]  chisasfam: theres a huge campaign in the UK by the gov to try and get everyone to insulate their homes so we dont have to use so much gas
[09:08:55]  chisasfam: and most of us do
[09:09:06]  chisasfam: but the problem with insulated homes is that they get TOO HOT in summer

[09:20:34]  chisasfam: "hey can i stream in your resteraunt" "no" "ok but are you actually gonna stop me" "no"
[09:22:02]  chisasfam: opinions on cities skylines?
[09:22:23]  chisasfam: hmm
[09:22:26]  chisasfam: streaming game
[09:22:29]  chisasfam: probably
[09:22:36]  chisasfam: it depends bc its just a chill city builder
[09:23:08]  chisasfam: it would be nice to see though
[09:23:16]  chisasfam: just get the game and a bunch of dlcs
[09:23:28]  chisasfam: also for halloween? hmm
[09:23:33]  chisasfam: play scp
[09:23:39]  chisasfam: Cities skylines is by Paradox
[09:23:58]  chisasfam: scp
[09:24:09]  chisasfam: its a free game, its a horror but also not really
[09:24:14]  chisasfam: YEAH ITS SPOOKY
[09:24:19]  chisasfam: theres no jumpscares in scp
[09:24:54]  chisasfam: if you were to buy cities skylines and every single DLC it would be 144 pounds
[09:25:00]  chisasfam: but the base game is 22
[09:25:12]  chisasfam: theres 34 dlcs in total
[09:25:23]  chisasfam: I play alot of scp theres no jumpscares
[09:25:48]  chisasfam: no
[09:25:54]  chisasfam: Yeah
[09:26:07]  chisasfam: SCP has no jumpscares its just spooky
[09:26:38]  chisasfam: yeah
[09:26:45]  chisasfam: but theres other SCPs not only that one
[09:27:13]  chisasfam: Like theres on , if you look at he will kill you, one where if you look away he will kill you
[09:27:19]  chisasfam: the goal is to escape the facility
[09:27:25]  chisasfam: you need to gather the keycards
[09:27:35]  chisasfam: and upgrade them in the upgrade room
[09:28:09]  chisasfam: its not super beginner friendly, they expect you to have like base knowladge on SCPs already before playing
[09:28:30]  chisasfam: play ODDTAXI by skirt and PUNPEE smh
[09:29:06]  chisasfam: or theres this game , its old, its called the hidden
[09:29:08]  chisasfam: its a song
[09:29:10]  chisasfam: but anyway
[09:29:19]  chisasfam: the game, the hidden you could stream that
[09:29:24]  chisasfam: and your discord could join
[09:29:30]  chisasfam: its free but its awkward to install
[09:30:23]  chisasfam: id suggest plague inc but that game sucks for streaming
[09:30:45]  chisasfam: you played portal one and two , why not Portal Reloaded ?
[09:30:59]  chisasfam: its free
[09:31:01]  chisasfam: its like
[09:31:05]  chisasfam: a spin off portal game
[09:31:48]  chisasfam: but yeah my only idea is SCP
[09:31:50]  chisasfam: for halloween
[09:32:26]  cupcake_chi: Isn’t it like 9 am in Japan
[09:32:36]  cupcake_chi: Hello zetties
[09:33:03]  chisasfam: i like spooky games and ones where the jumpscares only happen if you fail something and arent stragegic
[09:33:12]  chisasfam: but ones with scripted scares I dont like

[09:36:08]  chisasfam: zetto thinks when he goes to mexico itll be all yellow
[09:36:33]  chisasfam: and a steel string guitar will strum when he lands
[09:37:11]  chisasfam: and everyone will say aribba, vamanos , ese , taco, burrito , cuz
[09:37:46]  chisasfam: it depends, bc I dont feel like I fit in where I live rn
[09:37:53]  chisasfam: and I didnt have a sense of belonging in brasil either
[09:38:11]  chisasfam: thats why I want to move to japan to try and fix that and see if I find my sense of belonging there?
[09:38:38]  chisasfam: vamanos = lets go
