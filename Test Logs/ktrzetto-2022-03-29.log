[10:00:56]  laurabraus: you have to listen to music for a while before the recommendations become accurate
[10:01:11]  laurabraus: but even then the discovery weekly is usually trash
[10:01:16]  scottief: the oscars were so boring too
[10:01:36]  scottief: i mean i dont really care at the end of the day drive my car is easily the best movie that came out last year but woulda been nice to get some recognition
[10:01:41]  scottief: instead of the trash they gave the award to

[10:14:07]  andrewangus: the show is called 1 litre of tears and its apparently really sad if you couldn't tell :)
[10:14:36]  scottief: its cathartic
[10:14:39]  andrewangus: this is the vid he played https://youtu.be/IBEDfJQhzaI
[10:14:43]  scottief: you gotta be happy to be sad
[10:14:53]  andrewangus: LUL
[10:14:59]  scottief: its kinda a complicated concept tbh
[10:15:20]  andrewangus: the song goes hard
[10:15:33]  andrewangus: practically a music vid
[10:16:10]  scottief: its basically just like the release of emotions through some type of medium
[10:16:25]  scottief: like for instance getting a good cry out of a sad show
[10:16:45]  scottief: LUL
[10:16:55]  scottief: no that means you need to undergo catharsis
[10:17:12]  andrewangus: LULW
[10:17:13]  scottief: LUL
[10:17:23]  scottief: i dont know how to explain it lol

[10:26:16]  haine_sense1: ;)
[10:26:40]  scottief: we were talking about catharsis but zetto thought it was chiropractors
[10:27:00]  kaeos: no
[10:27:05]  andrewangus: no
[10:27:13]  haine_sense1: I don't think I'm gonna forget to resub - think it's actually automatic

[10:27:21]  haine_sense1: they're not the same
[10:27:50]  haine_sense1: they both begin with c's

[10:30:32]  scottief: well you didnt provide exp date
[10:30:36]  haine_sense1: true
[10:30:54]  haine_sense1: 7/22
[10:30:59]  andrewangus: LUL
[10:31:10]  kaeos: do they have amazon in japan
[10:31:25]  scottief: most credit cards by the same bank/provider start with the same four number i think
[10:31:31]  buttershooter_: AndrewAngus more like AnpooAngus OMEGALUL
[10:31:35]  andrewangus: D:
[10:31:37]  haine_sense1: @Scottief that sounds likely
[10:31:47]  buttershooter_: sorry that was too far
[10:31:59]  andrewangus: Bezos would not miss up that opportunity
[10:32:03]  kaeos: wait i get it its because andrew sounds like anpoo
[10:32:07]  scottief: bozos
[10:32:16]  haine_sense1: and while I suspect some of you will recognise those numbers... they came from pi and e
[10:32:29]  kaeos: do they have 2 day prime shipping in japan
[10:32:30]  andrewangus: how did i not notice that
[10:32:47]  haine_sense1: lol
[10:33:01]  andrewangus: Kapp
[10:33:13]  kirosthegreat: mmm there's hashing involved with modern credit card numbers anyway, but the first 4 digits can always identify card types and whether its a charge card or credit card.
[10:33:24]  buttershooter_: HERE I want this Sadge
[10:33:32]  andrewangus: THIS
[10:33:34]  andrewangus: THESE

[10:34:52]  kaeos: what are you doing
[10:34:56]  scottief: lmao
[10:35:15]  scottief: where is the time save on this run
[10:35:24]  haine_sense1: so, before I go... gotta check whether you ever got around to deleting...
[10:35:28]  haine_sense1: !pat @ktrZetto
[10:35:50]  haine_sense1: looks like you either did or I misremembered if it was pat or pet
[10:35:54]  scottief: !pet
[10:36:27]  zaide_chris: About cards, the 1st digit is the network of the card, next 5 are the company, last digit is a checksum. 3141 5926 5358 9793 doesn't pass the checksum test.
[10:36:36]  kaeos: u should bark as a points reward
[10:36:40]  scottief: you hate to see it
[10:36:53]  haine_sense1: I mean, like, pet the mods is a thing
[10:37:00]  haine_sense1: so petting isn't that uncommon here
[10:37:08]  haine_sense1: maybe in this stream
[10:37:25]  laurabraus: whats with all the furry talk
[10:37:29]  scottief: how much
[10:37:32]  kaeos: im not a furry
[10:37:42]  laurabraus: sounds like something a furry would say
[10:37:58]  kaeos: does liking cat girls make you a furry
[10:38:05]  laurabraus: no
[10:38:07]  kaeos: like just ears but not full fur
[10:38:20]  haine_sense1: how's about ears and tail only?
[10:38:28]  laurabraus: ohhh hmmmmm
[10:38:31]  kaeos: "a bunch of people"
[10:38:33]  scottief: how much to do it on an irl stream in public
[10:39:28]  haine_sense1: does extremely hairy body count as furry?
[10:39:55]  kaeos: do gorillas count as furry in that scenario
[10:40:10]  andrewangus: how much for the maid cafe
[10:40:23]  haine_sense1: how much for the bl cafe?
[10:41:10]  scottief: maid cafe POGGERS
[10:41:17]  kaeos: because some animals like snakes and stuff are different categories
[10:42:10]  kaeos: what if we pay for your anxiety meds too
[10:42:30]  scottief: it should exist
[10:42:39]  haine_sense1: there was a bl cafe at one point
[10:43:03]  haine_sense1: @kaeos oh no, don't remind me of scaleys
[10:43:32]  kaeos: you went up to 10 viewers then it halved after you started talking about maid cafes
[10:43:42]  andrewangus: LUL
[10:43:43]  scottief: arent most bl enjoyers women
[10:43:53]  kaeos: yeah u have a mod thats super into that
[10:43:53]  haine_sense1: I think basically they provide bl entertainment for you
[10:44:07]  haine_sense1: which I'm sure you would totally enjoy

[10:45:16]  scottief: Kreygasm
[10:45:35]  haine_sense1: guess I should speak to her...
[10:46:14]  haine_sense1: lol no
[10:46:17]  scottief: LUL
[10:46:30]  kaeos: i assume they pretend to seduce you like its a highschool romance anime
[10:47:05]  haine_sense1: nah, at least the one I saw had basically actors who perform bl stuff
[10:47:17]  andrewangus: perform
[10:47:28]  scottief: are we sure its gay
[10:47:32]  kaeos: the women bring their boyfriends in and attempt to make them gay
[10:47:39]  haine_sense1: pretty sure bl isn't gay ;)
[10:47:42]  scottief: perform
[10:48:04]  scottief: we know why Kapp
[10:48:37]  kaeos: im starting to do the math and i think that haine is gay
[10:48:47]  scottief: FACTS
[10:48:51]  haine_sense1: @kaeos wait...
[10:48:59]  haine_sense1: really?
[10:50:17]  kaeos: i thought you didnt stream todays
[10:50:26]  haine_sense1: basically... like guys messing around in classical bl scenes eg. eating each end of pocky until they end up kissing
[10:51:12]  haine_sense1: hm.......
[10:51:22]  kaeos: oh so ur like a nutcase rn
[10:51:32]  haine_sense1: and why haven't you been taking the meds?
[10:51:48]  scottief: i wish the stream refresh button still existed

[10:56:37]  kaeos: COPIUM
[10:57:23]  andrewangus: LUL
[10:57:36]  kaeos: i dont need copium since i know im the best
[10:57:52]  frostneptune: doomers man LUL
[10:58:14]  haine_sense1: Time to reference history and claim that actually everyone is bisexual and sexual preference for the same gender is only unusual because society saw it as wrong for a while and only the people who have particularly strong attraction to certain people of the same gender at some point and realise that they might like them.
[10:58:25]  kaeos: wtf
[10:58:27]  haine_sense1: and then completely ignore the claim since no one really cares
[10:58:29]  andrewangus: monkaS
[10:58:34]  haine_sense1: actually not a copypasta
[10:58:41]  haine_sense1: lol
[10:58:45]  kaeos: "realise" BRITISH OMEGALUL

[11:00:06]  scottief: yeah people dont know what cathartic means
[11:00:31]  kaeos: every once in awhile i relive the epiphany of realizing that british people are real and not accents made up for drama TV shows
[11:00:32]  haine_sense1: tbf I don't know what cathartic means and I even had to use it in essays in the past
[11:01:39]  scottief: OMEGALUL
[11:01:53]  haine_sense1: when I think of catharsis I think of a radwimps song
[11:02:12]  scottief: your name soundtrack is good tho
[11:02:18]  scottief: weathering with you sucked ass
[11:02:24]  kaeos: based

[11:03:46]  scottief: im surprised

[11:05:36]  haine_sense1: of course I know, but doesn't mean I can't still have fun with it
[11:05:59]  haine_sense1: ah sure

[11:06:30]  scottief: ur missing out on so much porn
[11:06:36]  scottief: just a huge loss tbh
[11:06:50]  scottief: you dont get to decide if ur a twink or not
[11:07:02]  kaeos: is there more gay porn than straight porn
[11:07:09]  haine_sense1: yes, scat porn is great Kappa
[11:07:15]  scottief: wait but scat porn does not represent a huge portion of porn
[11:07:46]  haine_sense1: pretty sure there's more straight porn than gay porn
[11:07:53]  scottief: i mean its the minority
[11:07:55]  kaeos: yeah but gay dudes have a lot of sex right
[11:08:03]  haine_sense1: just based on how little content I feel like I have to browse :(
