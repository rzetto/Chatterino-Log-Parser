[13:09:32]  kaeos: You can't call yourself a professional gamer if you lose this
[13:10:31]  haine_sense1: oh damn, guess I should leave then
[13:11:28]  kaeos: Sheer determination mechanic
[13:13:02]  haine_sense1: that mechanic's so weird
[13:13:43]  haine_sense1: and I presume the same never happens for opposition's Pokemon

[13:21:33]  haine_sense1: I only watch ends of things
[13:22:15]  haine_sense1: honestly probably gonna sleep
[13:23:01]  haine_sense1: it's stupidly late rn considering I'm somewhat supposed to be fixing my sleep schedule for uni
[13:23:55]  kaeos: You have no morals
[13:24:28]  haine_sense1: since on Tuesday I gotta get up for a meeting at 10am and same on Wednesday and then lectures start from then
[13:24:36]  chef_zack: LUL
[13:24:46]  haine_sense1: it's 4:24am rn
[13:25:18]  kaeos: Oui
[13:25:27]  haine_sense1: I didn't have any proper meals in the last 24 hours
[13:25:31]  haine_sense1: just lots of snacks
[13:25:53]  haine_sense1: some healthy snacks
[13:26:38]  haine_sense1: the day just kinda got fucked over by realising yesterday that I didn't have things to clean up stuff I get food in
[13:26:42]  haine_sense1: hence lots of snacks
[13:26:45]  haine_sense1: and no breakfast
[13:26:48]  haine_sense1: and no dinner
[13:27:01]  saltychildofthesea: i sense french in this chat daphPotion
[13:27:21]  haine_sense1: was it the single French word?
[13:27:27]  303devilfish: COGGERS
[13:27:41]  saltychildofthesea: oui ü•ñ daphPotion
[13:28:53]  saltychildofthesea: because hes special daphLook
[13:29:55]  saltychildofthesea: thats not what i meant daphPain
[13:30:11]  haine_sense1: but anyway, good luck beating cynthia - yes luck you can't beat her with skill
[13:30:52]  saltychildofthesea: yes like ‚ú® ùì¢ùìπùìÆùì¨ùì≤ùì™ùìµ ‚ú®
[13:31:03]  haine_sense1: out healing one pokemon
[13:32:20]  kaeos: Do owless :)

[13:33:16]  saltychildofthesea: cless when? monkaHmm
[13:33:31]  kaeos: You are pedantic
[13:34:12]  chef_zack: no
[13:34:12]  haine_sense1: no not pendantic
[13:34:18]  chef_zack: its like being knowledgable
[13:34:24]  haine_sense1: no
[13:34:29]  haine_sense1: not really
[13:34:42]  chef_zack: overly*
[13:34:48]  haine_sense1: being pedantic is pointing out errors unnecessarily
[13:35:05]  saltychildofthesea: basically being a smartass for no reason
[13:35:26]  haine_sense1: ^that
[13:35:41]  haine_sense1: like I do regularly
[13:36:18]  saltychildofthesea: daphScreechH NOOO
[13:37:06]  haine_sense1: I wonder what the probabilities behind that mechanic are
[13:37:45]  haine_sense1: yea, it seems to happen pretty often to the point that it's almost worth relying on sometimes
[13:38:56]  kaeos: Good night :)
[13:39:48]  haine_sense1: since I've never finished a Pokemon game, I'd just like to clarify, do you have to beat all the elite four in a row - without leaving and coming back for others?
[13:40:06]  haine_sense1: elite four +cythia is it?
[13:40:17]  saltychildofthesea: big bertha daphLook
[13:41:03]  haine_sense1: I think the only Pokemon I've come close to beating maybe is Yellow on game boy colour
[13:41:21]  saltychildofthesea: Prayge that was lucky asf
[13:41:47]  haine_sense1: though I suspect it's more likely that I got stuck pretty early on and gave up
[13:42:09]  saltychildofthesea: i beat alpha sapphire like 3 months ago HYPERS
[13:42:45]  chef_zack: last good pokemon  Sadge
[13:42:56]  saltychildofthesea: 7 years of trying daphPain

[13:52:34]  saltychildofthesea: its like choose the hill then gives you 9 pictures of roads
[13:52:43]  haine_sense1: captchas revealing the anxiety in society trying to prove it's not a bot
[13:53:59]  saltychildofthesea: the pokemon really said *dodges*
[13:54:26]  haine_sense1: KFC????
[13:55:24]  haine_sense1: ANOTHER STREAMER I WATCH IS CALLED CHICKENRUNNNN AND DOES LOTS OF CHICKEN THINGS
[13:55:37]  haine_sense1: anything related to chicken now reminds me of him
[13:56:37]  haine_sense1: kfc particularly since we talk about potentially getting a sponsorship with kfc
[13:57:14]  haine_sense1: I have never worked out whether it is actually possible or not
[13:58:05]  haine_sense1: their french
[13:58:09]  haine_sense1: they're*
[13:58:49]  haine_sense1: I tried to look up what sponsorships French KFC consider
[13:58:52]  haine_sense1: and fair
[13:58:54]  haine_sense1: failed*
[13:59:19]  haine_sense1: largely because if I tried to do so, all websites involved were in french
[13:59:57]  haine_sense1: oh you're here again
[14:00:10]  haine_sense1: they do stream in English/french
[14:00:35]  haine_sense1: it's basically speak English by default but switch to French if French chatters show up
[14:01:43]  saltychildofthesea: pommes de terre pepeD
[14:01:49]  haine_sense1: I would like to request that you never level up Tsu again

[14:02:47]  saltychildofthesea: nice
[14:02:50]  haine_sense1: that is why I made the request
[14:03:06]  haine_sense1: no
[14:03:14]  haine_sense1: just the previous method
[14:03:46]  haine_sense1: exactly
[14:03:56]  haine_sense1: but you have a much better English accent
[14:04:13]  haine_sense1: in that it's easier to understand without concentrating
[14:04:54]  chef_zack: nah just ice beam EZ
[14:05:16]  chef_zack: Pog
[14:05:18]  chef_zack: dead

[14:08:29]  haine_sense1: @laurabraus were you taking a break from your phone? if so, that sounds quite reasonable
[14:08:53]  chef_zack: well you dont heal
[14:09:19]  bellsexpress1: I heard this was the easiest pokemon game yet, is that wrong?
[14:09:34]  bellsexpress1: ohhh
[14:09:36]  chef_zack: sword is the easiest
[14:09:50]  saltychildofthesea: @laurabraus its fine HYPERS
[14:10:04]  chef_zack: i was gonna say x and y but i realized that game told you exactly where to go and you one shot every single pokemon
[14:10:15]  saltychildofthesea: taking breaks from devices is really good PogChamp
[14:10:19]  chef_zack: sword and shield does*
[14:11:45]  haine_sense1: anyway, I'm actually gonna go now (yes, this is the third time I've said something along those lines, but eh - it's gonna be proper this time) so hope you fail so I can see you get it some other time :)

[14:15:09]  laurabraus: @saltychildofthesea soon for sure...
[14:15:57]  chef_zack: researching video games?
[14:16:09]  laurabraus: yeah im trying to figure out which one i want next
[14:16:14]  haine_sense1: @laurabraus sounds like a good reason
[14:16:39]  chef_zack: i thought that game looked really rough when the first showed it
[14:16:42]  chef_zack: looks very good now
[14:17:18]  chef_zack: star allies was mediocre
[14:17:26]  laurabraus: i love kirby...
[14:17:34]  laurabraus: i would buy a swich just for that new game coming out
[14:17:51]  laurabraus: a switch is so expensive though my god
[14:17:52]  chef_zack: yeah march 25th
[14:18:16]  laurabraus: its like $360 here
[14:18:42]  laurabraus: yeah used ones go for $280-310
[14:18:42]  chef_zack: i bought a 2nd one for modding for 216
[14:19:02]  laurabraus: man 216 is really good
[14:19:09]  chef_zack: well it was just the tablet
[14:19:13]  laurabraus: but now the new OLED ones have better battery...
[14:19:27]  laurabraus: @Chef_Zack oh smhhhhh
[14:19:43]  chef_zack: like if you want a cheap switch you could find a used lite
[14:20:10]  laurabraus: but i dont wanna buy a lite when i could pay 100 dollars more and just get the full version
[14:20:19]  laurabraus: if i get one im going all out
[14:20:48]  chef_zack: id check ebay or something, cause people probably sold alot of their switches to buy oled models
[14:21:57]  laurabraus: i have a saved search on mercari for one rn
[14:22:13]  laurabraus: theres a lot there im just. i hate spending money
[14:22:44]  laurabraus: yeah ive heard they have 3h of battery
[14:22:57]  laurabraus: which for a handheld is SO LOW
[14:23:06]  laurabraus: but so many people use it as a console honestly
[14:23:20]  chef_zack: thats not entirely true.
[14:23:31]  laurabraus: which part
[14:23:38]  laurabraus: zack is about to educate my pants off
[14:24:02]  chef_zack: the switch battery seems to get like 5/7 hours depending on which game you play.
[14:24:31]  chef_zack: 3 hours was when the switch first launched and that was cause people were playing botw
[14:24:47]  chef_zack: and the oled model has like up to 9 hours
[14:28:15]  cosmicmikan: istg fire emblem sucked my battery so fast
[14:28:33]  chef_zack: LUL
[14:28:35]  laurabraus: LMAO
[14:28:36]  303devilfish: pepeD
[14:28:40]  chef_zack: or just R)
[14:29:05]  cosmicmikan: ktr the unofficial n64 spokesperson
[14:29:17]  303devilfish: 1
[14:29:25]  laurabraus: well the real reason i dont want to buy one is because last year i just bought a psvita because i really like playing visual novels and its great for those
[14:29:37]  cosmicmikan: oh hell yeah
[14:29:41]  laurabraus: but now switch is getting visual novels....AND REALLY GOOD ONES
[14:30:07]  laurabraus: @cosmicmikan he really could get hired by nintendo they should be paying him
[14:30:13]  cosmicmikan: HONESTLY
