[10:24:21]  cosmicmikan: ktrzetNOOO
[10:24:23]  kirosthegreat: Depends on the bug I think. Quickly spawning insects can easily repopulate and environments can adapt with a temporary loss of population, but if you kill off an entire swarm of cicada that only emerge once every 13 or 17 years, then the predators who naturally survive on them will largely go hungry and start a change reaction in the local ecosystem & may spread to a regional level in enough time

[11:22:28]  303devilfish: nyannSleepy
[11:22:45]  haine_sense1: Hoi
[11:22:51]  cosmicmikan: gn
[11:22:51]  nightbot: https://clips.twitch.tv/GeniusCovertSalmonItsBoshyTime-NECqGzkggZv8lT-v
[11:22:59]  haine_sense1: Sorry I‚Äôm a bit late to stream
[11:23:24]  haine_sense1: Was having emotional conversation
[11:24:10]  haine_sense1: Followed by an emotional ‚Äúis this weird relationship I have with someone healthy?‚Äù
[11:25:23]  cosmicmikan: yeah i just block if i feel weirded out
[11:26:17]  haine_sense1: Oh, dw, it‚Äôs not weird in the sense of it‚Äôs not good, it‚Äôs just weird in the sense of extremely one sided, but understood to be so by both sides lol
[11:27:19]  haine_sense1: Yea, it‚Äôs just weird because it‚Äôs kinda unusual lol
[11:27:28]  cosmicmikan: yeah im the same
[11:27:40]  cosmicmikan: prolly why our dms are the sahara
[11:27:59]  cosmicmikan: i feel bad bothering them
[11:28:07]  cosmicmikan: and i dont wanna bug
[11:29:28]  haine_sense1: More specifically, basically, I have kinda developed a massive attachment to one of the world‚Äôs best competition climbers.
[11:30:01]  laurabraus: do you admire them though
[11:30:24]  laurabraus: like is your love for them feeling like a negative thing thats holding you back or a positive thing thats motivating you
[11:30:53]  haine_sense1: I message him quite a lot on Instagram, he responds sometimes, but likes a quite a few of my messages. Generally his responses are all positive, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm really bothering him
[11:31:12]  laurabraus: ohhh you're like actually in contact with him too
[11:31:13]  haine_sense1: And yea, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really hurting me
[11:31:17]  haine_sense1: Yea
[11:31:45]  haine_sense1: It‚Äôs just like, weird lol
[11:32:28]  laurabraus: just as long as you dont make someone worth so much that you forget your own worth
[11:32:38]  laurabraus: then i think it's fine to support someone
[11:34:35]  haine_sense1: Yea
[11:36:29]  laurabraus: it's terrible tbh i don't recommend
[11:38:41]  laurabraus: i guess i just realized eventually they're only human too. even though i felt hyper-fixated on them i still only knew like 1% of their life and only the parts they wanted me to know, which is like all friendships but it's to an extreme online. like a controlled environment
[11:38:45]  laurabraus: yeah
[11:41:00]  laurabraus: this person wasn't THAT popular like not the top of anything but they did have a fanbase and we were pretty distant. the "occasionally messages back" and "likes some of my messages" and "is generally nice though" were all things that happened to me too so it still felt relevant
[11:42:38]  laurabraus: are you still playing against AI
[11:42:52]  laurabraus: LMAOOOO
[11:45:23]  laurabraus: LOL
[11:45:45]  laurabraus: yeah i appreciate that you dont even lie when you dont wanna talk
[11:45:57]  laurabraus: like if you have nothing to say you are NOT gonna say anything
[11:46:57]  cosmicmikan: aweee
