[14:31:36]  infynoko: My parents were both really into games, so I'd already had years of SNES at that point.

[14:35:00]  infynoko: My mum was playing Tetris on the original Game Boy all through labour. LUL
[14:35:52]  infynoko: Yeah, a lot of my friends didn't play games until they were like 12.
[14:37:23]  infynoko: Probably because I was literally pre-school, but the game I remember being super hard as a near baby was DKC2.
[14:38:13]  infynoko: I think everyone has had that brick wall game.
[14:38:29]  infynoko: Damn, unlucky.
[14:38:53]  infynoko: Nah I mean like a game that really puts them in their place.
[14:39:22]  infynoko: DKC1 and 2 are amazing, but 3 is kinda ass.
[14:40:05]  infynoko: 3 is on SNES, but they changed a lot of things.
[14:41:26]  infynoko: I think DKC1 was like '94 or something?
[14:44:16]  infynoko: Damn, Konpeko for 1k.
[14:45:04]  infynoko: Oh, you have to say it?
[14:45:10]  infynoko: Thought it was a sound clip.
[14:45:31]  infynoko: Almond almond and all.
