[11:59:22]  laurabraus: today i mean
[11:59:57]  laurabraus: i mean it took me like 9 months to hit 100k points. so 10 years LMAO
[12:00:16]  robertzarmy: without betting getting channel points is beyond a chore
[12:00:19]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice.
