[04:32:57]  haine_sense1: wait, did I scare away a mod?
[04:34:10]  haine_sense1: They don’t have to… they can just assume I’m making some inappropriate commebt
[04:34:13]  haine_sense1: comment
[04:34:41]  haine_sense1: True…
[04:34:45]  haine_sense1: That would be baf
[04:34:48]  haine_sense1: bad

[04:34:59]  cosmicmikan: im a good mod
[04:35:24]  haine_sense1: I feel like that’s sort of against the point of a mod
[04:35:58]  cosmicmikan: well besides the obvious trolll/bot
[04:36:34]  haine_sense1: And also the reason I have always avoided being a mod - I don’t trust my own judgement
[04:37:20]  haine_sense1: Yea, true tbf I remember that being an issue in other streans
[04:37:23]  haine_sense1: streams

[04:38:57]  cosmicmikan: i wanna try karaoke. im a shit singer, but i'd still do it
[04:39:20]  haine_sense1: I’ve done karaoke in discord vc’s before
[04:39:32]  cosmicmikan: naa i gotta do that with friends. they have to witness the disaster
[04:39:59]  haine_sense1: The thing you questioned was just about how I actually tried to not be weird
[04:40:11]  nightbot: Hit the follow button if you enjoy the stream so you can come back for more! 配信が面白かったらフォローしてね！
[04:40:19]  haine_sense1: It’s much more fun to just mess around
[04:40:49]  haine_sense1: Well it’s not normally actual karaoke
[04:40:59]  haine_sense1: More like just singing something without backing
[04:41:06]  haine_sense1: (Though I have backing)
[04:41:29]  haine_sense1: (They just can’t hear it)
[04:42:07]  haine_sense1: Though I didn’t have any backing track playing when I was singing my own songs
[04:42:22]  haine_sense1: Since I’ve never produced any backing tracks for them
[04:42:41]  haine_sense1: But that’s not karaoke so much
[04:43:28]  haine_sense1: You probably mean a Capella
[04:43:33]  haine_sense1: or something
[04:44:11]  haine_sense1: A few
[04:44:46]  haine_sense1: I wrote them when I was in terrible mental state as a sort of way to express myself
[04:45:14]  haine_sense1: Since I found talking hard but singing easier
[04:45:42]  haine_sense1: Partially since if they’re good enough you can pass them off as real songs ;)
[04:46:48]  haine_sense1: Yea I get you
[04:46:55]  haine_sense1: Oh my crush posted must go chrck
[04:48:14]  haine_sense1: There, responded

[04:58:59]  haine_sense1: No
[04:59:16]  cosmicmikan: i usually eat a bagel with smoked salmon
[04:59:20]  haine_sense1: I just felt like calling it breakfast cereal to make it sound important

[04:59:50]  cosmicmikan: LOL make that noise again

[05:10:10]  haine_sense1: Some people may say “oi bruv” but that doesn’t mean that you’re good at saying it with a British accent
[05:10:22]  scratchatk: ktrzetAY オイ
[05:10:38]  cosmicmikan: ayy nice

[05:26:18]  haine_sense1: I think it’s fine to say that to someone you know but maybe not random person in chat
[05:26:24]  cosmicmikan: ok bet
[05:26:26]  cosmicmikan: i could cop
[05:27:43]  haine_sense1: Why is it that time went really quickly for the first week of term and now it’s going really slowly?

[05:38:22]  acemussel: EZ covid dodgers
[05:38:26]  haine_sense1: I’m just hoping it’s not in the maths department
[05:39:36]  acemussel: very nice zetto good work
[05:41:04]  haine_sense1: But yea, the maths faculty are clearly being an outlier in Cambridge since we occasionally receive emails from the uni or other and they say “use an LFT before going to in person meetings” and im like “so you want me to use it every day before going to lectures?”
[05:41:14]  acemussel: dude are the angles fucked
[05:41:21]  acemussel: you seem like your moving so slow
[05:41:36]  krystenxo: yo zetto gl kryste6Love2

[05:42:21]  krystenxo: yeah that made no sense to me lmao
[05:42:54]  kaeos: why do u have a money goal to play arceus
[05:42:55]  acemussel: COPIUM must be the controller
[05:43:02]  haine_sense1: You need a new sub goal
[05:43:04]  kaeos: itll pay for itself with the insane viewership youll get
[05:43:31]  acemussel: legit fungible token
[05:43:42]  haine_sense1: Lateral flow test - the speed tests
[05:43:57]  acemussel: actually walking sometimes PepeLaugh
[05:45:01]  krystenxo: Did you see my clip of the weird WDW blj that made no sense? Lol
[05:45:16]  krystenxo: It was in the last kobrah video I believe
[05:45:29]  haine_sense1: How much is a controller?
[05:45:52]  musicelliott: Need a GoFundMe for a new Zetto controller

[06:03:09]  krystenxo: Eating a pizza & playing arceus sounds so relaxing

[06:07:07]  kaeos: zack this isnt a mature audience stream u dont have to self censor

[06:08:32]  chef_zack: i said penis music

[06:09:32]  haine_sense1: what's a soy boy again?
[06:09:33]  chef_zack: if you dab your pizza, you can eat more pizza
[06:09:37]  krystenxo: I know you’re pretty much done with 16, but when are we racing again? Lol
[06:10:40]  haine_sense1: "Soy boy is a pejorative term often used in online communities to describe men lacking masculine characteristics."
[06:10:48]  chef_zack: its like calling someone a wus
[06:10:50]  haine_sense1: ooohhhh... so that's why gay guys love you
[06:11:42]  kaeos: its because soy allegedly increases estrogen, therefore making a soy boy less masculine
[06:12:56]  krystenxo: I’m also down whenever, just lmk
[06:13:08]  chef_zack: no you'
[06:13:14]  chef_zack: 're saying it correctly

[06:14:41]  kaeos: idk if thats actually true but its where i heard it came frame
[06:14:45]  chef_zack: you'd have to consume so much of said soy before it started affecting your physically.
[06:14:49]  krystenxo: Either or
[06:14:50]  kaeos: from*
[06:15:50]  haine_sense1: imma guess you're gonna die

[06:26:41]  chef_zack: imagine 8 people racing and im betting on you
[06:26:46]  haine_sense1: I wonder how often someone makes a dono goal and then they achieve it in one day and an extra 25%?
[06:26:50]  kaeos: it seems u get worse the more money u have
[06:26:53]  kaeos: we need to keep u poor

[06:32:31]  kaeos: no he's trolling
[06:32:37]  haine_sense1: it's not an English name
[06:32:43]  chef_zack: ^
[06:32:45]  haine_sense1: everyone gets it wrong anyway lol
[06:33:34]  haine_sense1: apparently Euler was from Switzerland
[06:33:37]  chef_zack: probably french cause the pronunciation makes no sense
[06:33:57]  chef_zack: nvm haine probably knows
[06:34:40]  kaeos: swiss cheese

[06:44:27]  kaeos: i dont like pizza, its just crushed tomatoes, fermented yeast and water, and old milk
[06:44:54]  haine_sense1: fermented yeast :0
[06:45:40]  chef_zack: i dont like pizza crust, its just bacteria
[06:45:43]  haine_sense1: I feel like cheese probably isn't normally made from old milk
[06:46:05]  kaeos: i dont like food, its literally just molecules
[06:46:44]  musicelliott: I think the next fundraiser should be 3 hours at a Hostess club for Zetto

[07:21:39]  kaeos: happym56Wtf
[07:22:19]  haine_sense1: you have never had a good rr

[07:31:10]  kaeos: If you're alone and choking, follow these steps:  1. Make a fist and place it just above your navel, thumb side in. 2. Grab the fist with your other hand and push it inward and upward at the same time. Perform five of these abdominal thrusts. 3. Repeat until the object is expelled and you can breathe or cough on your own.

[07:31:50]  kiy0t3: damn macro
[07:32:14]  303devilfish: The universal sign for choking is hands clutched to the throat. If the person doesn't give the signal, look for these indications: Inability to talk Difficulty breathing or noisy breathing Squeaky sounds when trying to breathe
[07:32:33]  haine_sense1: ok, that was confusing
[07:32:48]  haine_sense1: it looked like you actually just bonked on nothing
