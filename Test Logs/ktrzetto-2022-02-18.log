[12:01:11]  lovelyfreya: It's ok KTR the majority of people in the states that get their news from the TV or newspaper are primarily more towards geriatric ages, not all of course, just the majority.

[12:43:09]  chisasfam: You know earlier how I mentioned a storm in the uk, well it cancelled all of my trains
[12:44:10]  chisasfam: The earliest train I can get is at 10am, I am supposed to start at 9 and finish at 12 , if I get the 10:08 train I‚Äôll only get the Liverpool at 10:40 meaning I‚Äôll get to college at 11 meaning I‚Äôll have 1 hour of practice room time, which is practically 0 time
[12:44:27]  chef_zack: Prayge
[12:44:29]  chisasfam: Bc I normally get the 8am train but it‚Äôs cancelled

[14:03:03]  ledoeh: why is it not kingdom hearts Sadge
[14:03:22]  cosmicmikan: KH is so good rip
[14:03:30]  ledoeh: g e t    i t
[14:04:12]  cosmicmikan: arent they making switch versions of it or something
[14:04:20]  cosmicmikan: hmmm no clue
[14:04:23]  ledoeh: there is pc version already
[14:04:32]  cosmicmikan: idk if thats true or not
[14:04:37]  cosmicmikan: HELL YEAH
[14:04:38]  ledoeh: switch version is cloud version
[14:04:43]  cosmicmikan: dance water dance
[14:04:52]  ledoeh: so F the switch version
[14:05:17]  ledoeh: noo :D you stream the game, not install it
[14:06:53]  ledoeh: nowadays the pc version is highly recommended because of mods but also very expensive compared to ps versions
[14:07:28]  chef_zack: BatChest kingdom hearts
[14:10:14]  cosmicmikan: i still have to finish 3
[14:10:17]  cosmicmikan: one day
[14:10:26]  ledoeh: but to answer your question.. no you dont need to necessarily play kingdom hearts 1, because for the lore there is like just a little bit happening
[14:10:47]  ledoeh: if i start to tell you what KH is about we are not done in 6h
[14:10:50]  chef_zack: "lore"
[14:10:54]  ledoeh: nooo its not long
[14:11:34]  chef_zack: 1 and 2 are decent games
[14:12:13]  ledoeh: well there lore is endlessly long :D but the playtime is medium
[14:13:02]  ledoeh: friendship KEKW
[14:13:12]  ledoeh: LUL
[14:13:31]  chef_zack: its like if metal gear solid had like 8 games with an overly complicated story
[14:14:02]  chef_zack: yes
[14:14:12]  ledoeh: well thats what i like about it, you can never see whats happening next
[14:14:55]  chef_zack: the musics good
[14:15:15]  chef_zack: if you like disney its a fun action rpg
[14:15:35]  ledoeh: tbh i dont like the disney aspect of it too much
[14:15:35]  chef_zack: its like 40$ on epic games for 1 and 2
[14:16:30]  chef_zack: i think thats the most appealing part. because otherwise its just final fantasy characters doing anime shit
