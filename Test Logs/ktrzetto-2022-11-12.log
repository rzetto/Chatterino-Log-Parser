[11:32:50]  laurabraus: insane
[11:33:10]  laurabraus: LOL
[11:33:25]  laurabraus: usually im that way too. my friend in high school wanted to go
[11:33:44]  scratchatk: 60" tvs, 720p
[11:35:03]  laurabraus: yeah i almost had to do that at gamestop
[11:35:09]  laurabraus: but i decided to quit after two weeks
[11:35:50]  laurabraus: i did have to work on the day that need for speed came out. my first shift
[11:36:13]  laurabraus: yeah everyone paid in cash
[11:36:18]  laurabraus: some people only paid in singles
[11:36:23]  laurabraus: for a $60 game
[11:36:29]  laurabraus: so that was the area of town i was in
[11:37:23]  laurabraus: that job frankly was just full of blows
[11:37:43]  303devilfish: strippers
[11:37:47]  laurabraus: i was like is this drug money. what is this
[11:37:48]  laurabraus: exactly
[11:38:35]  laurabraus: im not sure. it was my first day so i couldnt even open the register or open the drawers with the games
[11:39:15]  laurabraus: wtf
[11:39:21]  laurabraus: i didnt know
[11:39:37]  laurabraus: plebs
[11:40:59]  laurabraus: well every time someone bought or sold a game with us we made a profile for them. so we had to ask for weight height eye color and all that
[11:41:32]  laurabraus: because if they 1. sell us a game that turns out to be stolen or 2. sell a rated M game they bought from us to a minor it could get us in trouble
[11:41:36]  laurabraus: i think that was the reasoning
[11:42:11]  laurabraus: i forget if it was every bought game
[11:42:24]  laurabraus: cause i literally only worked there like 16 hours total
[11:44:46]  laurabraus: GO GO GO GO
