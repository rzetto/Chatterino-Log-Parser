[13:10:40]  kaeos: First of all during release they had not removed any of the glitches of the originals also added a softlock in the 7th gym which at least they fixed some of. I glitched through the floor before too in bdsp. But also they removed Cyrus' speech from Platinum which was not really necessary. Now team Galactic seems really weird as a group in total where the members is kinda Team Rocket stealing Pokemon but Cyrus more like Maxie or Archie
