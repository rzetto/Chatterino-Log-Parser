[09:43:39]  haine_sense1: Did you know that in France, they‚Äôre trying to enforce French alternative names for streamers, pro gamers, and similar things because they think that anglicised terminology is impurifying their language?

[10:06:06]  haine_sense1: Basic thing is that it probably just won‚Äôt work since the ban is only for government officials and similar
[10:06:21]  haine_sense1: And the words are so heavily instilled in the community

[10:14:55]  kippykat4774: it's this stream @Haine_Sense1
[10:14:58]  haine_sense1: Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been having like 1 meal a day
