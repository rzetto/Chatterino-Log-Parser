[10:27:29]  kaeos: Trae Young’s 1st playoff run stats: PPG : 28.4 RPG : 3.7 APG : 9.7 TS% : 60.3 At 22 years old he led his team to the ECF. Underrated playoffs run IMO.
[10:27:30]  kirosthegreat: It's kinda just speculation either way. There's no solid consensus as no one knows for sure - we can only assume based on tests. Different studies have gotten different results based on tones, rhythm, and context. It's safer to assume that some dogs get what their name is when they respond the same regardless of tone, and some dogs only rely on pitch
[10:27:42]  laurabraus: snow land
[10:28:19]  kaeos: basketball
[10:29:12]  kaeos: STEVE IS GOING TO KILL SMASH
