[08:17:07]  babsmcnh: then yeah a lot of them arent funny
[08:17:15]  babsmcnh: like the standard meme format
[08:18:08]  babsmcnh: like a picture
[08:18:16]  babsmcnh: and then they say a relatable thing
[08:18:28]  babsmcnh: that hasnothing really to do wit hthe picture

[08:26:14]  babsmcnh: that must be it
[08:26:38]  babsmcnh: yeah the whole song does kinda suck
[08:26:43]  kaeos: the rocks part sucked because it was just an ad for teremana tequila

[08:28:10]  babsmcnh: yea
[08:28:13]  babsmcnh: why
[08:28:23]  babsmcnh: bro he asked 'whats teremana tequila"
[08:28:31]  kaeos: "50 is average" is showing
[08:28:33]  babsmcnh: as if he didnt know what tequila is
[08:28:40]  babsmcnh: the fuck
[08:28:52]  babsmcnh: smh i guess this isnt a safe space no more Sadge
[08:29:09]  babsmcnh: i didnt know the brand either

[08:30:04]  kaeos: for a european
[08:30:09]  babsmcnh: bro
[08:30:14]  nightbot: What's up, local degenerate shillbot here to tell you that if you have Amazon Prime, you can link it with your Twitch account for a free sub!
[08:30:20]  babsmcnh: im not eurpean dude
[08:30:22]  babsmcnh: im from bermuda
[08:30:28]  babsmcnh: and i did uni in NA
[08:30:33]  kaeos: same thing

[08:30:38]  babsmcnh: wtf
[08:31:02]  babsmcnh: ur BBH is actually pretty good
[08:31:07]  babsmcnh: consistent
[08:31:33]  babsmcnh: ur ground pounds have not been sharp but practice is practice
[08:32:12]  babsmcnh: its okay that you +42 cuz THIS IS THE RUN
[08:32:50]  babsmcnh: THIS is a fucking booby emote
[08:32:58]  babsmcnh: what the actual fuck zetto
[08:33:11]  babsmcnh: we're going to be speaking in emotes soon
[08:33:24]  babsmcnh: ktrzetCheer FeelsStrongMan Pog BillyPosingWithHisCuteWaifus
[08:33:45]  kaeos: back to hieroglyphs
[08:34:27]  babsmcnh: no reset Kapp
[08:34:45]  babsmcnh: im waiting to peepoWTF when he resets
[08:35:08]  babsmcnh: nice nice
[08:35:16]  babsmcnh: not nice
[08:35:31]  babsmcnh: very not nice
[08:35:34]  kaeos: lol
[08:35:43]  babsmcnh: i dont think its clippable though
[08:36:37]  babsmcnh: ...
[08:36:45]  babsmcnh: just do iti
[08:36:49]  babsmcnh: end it please
[08:36:57]  babsmcnh: end the run
[08:37:04]  kaeos: why do they know what space time is in the new pokemon but they dont have plumbing
[08:37:24]  babsmcnh: space time is easy
[08:37:51]  babsmcnh: zetto you think that there is alien life outside of earth?
[08:38:18]  kaeos: that question implies theres alien life inside of earth
[08:38:34]  babsmcnh: monkaS OH SHIT TIME TO CRAWL BACK IN
[08:39:05]  babsmcnh: i hope i never meet aliens
[08:39:16]  babsmcnh: the idea is so terrifying because of the implications
[08:39:37]  babsmcnh: like we have ethics and shit
[08:39:49]  babsmcnh: but to other animals that would just be inefficient
[08:40:23]  babsmcnh: if aliens have such advanced technology and their social structure is different then its most likely they are strict
[08:40:56]  babsmcnh: also if its like a hivemind type of alien they dont have to think about that type of shit
[08:40:56]  kaeos: would u fuck a bipedal featherless alien
[08:41:20]  babsmcnh: so seeing the arts and philophosy stuff would be like ur reaction to memes
[08:41:30]  babsmcnh: like wtf are these dumbasses doing
[08:41:49]  babsmcnh: yeah if they're the first to do like space travel and they meet us
[08:42:21]  babsmcnh: im slightly confident that the first to do certain things have been more unethical
[08:42:50]  babsmcnh: whats their hypothetical sex organ kaeos
[08:43:11]  kaeos: idk whatever fish have
[08:43:26]  babsmcnh: also a bipedal featherless alien sounds like what aliens would think humans are OMEGALUL
[08:43:38]  babsmcnh: @kaeos fussy
[08:43:40]  babsmcnh: mmm
[08:43:54]  kaeos: yeah thats what plato said humans are
[08:44:00]  babsmcnh: if it doesnt hurt and its consensual on both sides then why not
[08:44:12]  babsmcnh: ahh interesting
[08:44:24]  babsmcnh: idk zetto has a good point on ethics
[08:44:44]  kaeos: yes
[08:44:48]  babsmcnh: but at the same time using that theory means like SJWs are the smartest beings
[08:45:02]  babsmcnh: you know fish have teeth zetto
[08:45:12]  nightbot: Hit the follow button if you enjoy the stream so you can come back for more! 配信が面白かったらフォローしてね！
[08:45:33]  babsmcnh: yeah but whats the limit for ethics
[08:45:37]  babsmcnh: ethics is subjective
[08:45:45]  babsmcnh: ahhh
[08:46:05]  babsmcnh: yeah but powerful people do dumb shit
[08:46:11]  babsmcnh: like buy NFT
[08:46:41]  babsmcnh: hmmm interesting
[08:47:09]  babsmcnh: idk i was on a space video spree
[08:47:27]  babsmcnh: and like the likelihood that theres aliens with the same psychology as us
[08:47:37]  babsmcnh: seems astounding low imo
[08:48:08]  babsmcnh: like every other creature doesnt like ooooo i'll make my house look pretty
[08:48:34]  babsmcnh: ooo ill chew some gum for other people
[08:48:44]  babsmcnh: like uh
[08:49:03]  babsmcnh: like i chew gum just in case my breath smells
[08:49:10]  babsmcnh: like pretty often
[08:49:35]  babsmcnh: just because im scared in case people are judgemental
[08:50:10]  babsmcnh: i feel like a smart species that is an alpha in a world wouldnt have societal concepts like this
[08:50:19]  babsmcnh: i mean in the middle of the day or at night
[08:50:30]  babsmcnh: mouthwash only goes so far
[08:51:48]  babsmcnh: yeah but its a waste of thought and resources if it makes sense - you just need to brush ur teeth and floss technically
[08:52:00]  babsmcnh: mouth wash and gum are secondary
[08:52:18]  babsmcnh: ur ground pounds OMEGALUL
[08:53:25]  babsmcnh: bro i wanna publish ur rage there
[08:53:38]  babsmcnh: or i just wanna save it but its not funny enough smh
[08:53:45]  babsmcnh: shouldve reacted harder
[08:54:17]  babsmcnh: thats a good quality to have
[08:54:27]  babsmcnh: especially for speedrunning
[08:55:08]  babsmcnh: bro i just sound like a dumbass when im angry in game
[08:55:18]  babsmcnh: i start stuttering and shit
[08:55:26]  babsmcnh: but im not angry at people
[08:55:39]  babsmcnh: uh probably fps versus friends
[08:55:45]  babsmcnh: ye you nailedddd it
[08:56:00]  babsmcnh: i keep getting headshot and im like CMONNNN MANNNN
[08:56:02]  babsmcnh: PepeHands
[08:56:10]  babsmcnh: bro you dont have pepehands EITHERRR
[08:56:20]  babsmcnh: not a true streamer
[08:56:46]  babsmcnh: you had pepeLaugh before maybe pepeHands is the same
[08:56:49]  babsmcnh: nope.
[08:57:16]  babsmcnh: widepeepoSad
[08:57:22]  babsmcnh: probably
[08:57:36]  babsmcnh: oh yeah i got jackbox
[08:57:45]  babsmcnh: and you know im not an actual troll
[08:58:04]  babsmcnh: so if you wanted to do a community night we could play that
[08:58:08]  babsmcnh: the game zetto.
[08:58:23]  babsmcnh: jackbox the restaurant does not exist in the UK
[08:58:26]  babsmcnh: lmao
[08:58:29]  babsmcnh: bro
[08:58:39]  babsmcnh: I WAS TRYING SO HARD NOT TO CALL YOU A DUMBASS
[08:58:40]  babsmcnh: AHHHHH
[08:58:49]  babsmcnh: i was like ok he'll figure it out right
[08:58:57]  babsmcnh: Sadge my streamer
[08:59:06]  babsmcnh: it happens
[08:59:38]  babsmcnh: whats ur favourite genre of like films and shows
[08:59:53]  babsmcnh: this was a completely random question but i swear it connected in my brain
[09:00:10]  babsmcnh: that was close
[09:00:33]  babsmcnh: whenever mario does the slow slide i wanna scream
[09:01:00]  babsmcnh: you still saved time
[09:01:08]  haine_sense1: How’s stuff been going?
[09:01:13]  babsmcnh: good dark world
[09:01:28]  babsmcnh: sup haine ktrzetHi
[09:01:41]  haine_sense1: Sounds like it’s going really well
[09:01:46]  babsmcnh: gimme examples of time travel shows
[09:01:52]  babsmcnh: its being going horribly
[09:02:03]  babsmcnh: zetto has unlearnt ground pounding unfortunately
[09:02:10]  haine_sense1: Oh, cool
[09:02:18]  babsmcnh: but its fine YEP
[09:02:30]  babsmcnh: say films then
[09:02:33]  haine_sense1: Back to the future
[09:02:40]  babsmcnh: ah shit
[09:02:42]  babsmcnh: trueee
[09:02:48]  babsmcnh: is that it
[09:02:55]  babsmcnh: oh sorry i lagge
[09:03:05]  haine_sense1: What? There are other time travel movies?
[09:03:16]  haine_sense1: I thought back to the future was the only one
[09:03:20]  babsmcnh: thats why i was confused its such a niche genre
[09:03:22]  haine_sense1: Naming anime movies is cheating
[09:03:31]  babsmcnh: ^
[09:03:37]  babsmcnh: endgame was garbage
[09:03:40]  babsmcnh: i mean
[09:03:51]  babsmcnh: AYAYA
[09:04:10]  babsmcnh: i didnt like the aspect of time travel in endgame
[09:04:22]  babsmcnh: if they went to parallel universes
[09:04:31]  haine_sense1: Lol, I know
[09:04:33]  babsmcnh: which are completely seperate to theirs
[09:04:41]  babsmcnh: how the fuck did cap america come back
[09:04:45]  haine_sense1: I can’t even remember what the girl who leapt through time was about
[09:04:49]  babsmcnh: am i confused or something
[09:05:09]  haine_sense1: But no
[09:05:13]  babsmcnh: i dont like many physics movies because they get it so wrong man
[09:05:16]  haine_sense1: There isn’t another reality where they survived
[09:05:19]  haine_sense1: Didn’t you hear?
[09:05:30]  haine_sense1: Dr Strange analysed them all and found only one solution
[09:06:02]  babsmcnh: like christopher nolan is the only one who actually goes through the script multiple times to make sure it makes complete sense
[09:06:25]  babsmcnh: you know what was funny
[09:06:39]  babsmcnh: i saw a pic of spiderman no way home
[09:06:42]  haine_sense1: Oh you’re suggesting that realities that Dr strange could analyse where only the ones in the “light cone” of the current position?
[09:07:09]  babsmcnh: i dont hink im that much of a critic - i like specific types of movies but i cant describe them
[09:07:15]  babsmcnh: wait you havent watched it?
[09:07:46]  haine_sense1: Lol
[09:08:09]  haine_sense1: I was just referring to stuff via relativity ;)
[09:08:11]  babsmcnh: wait let me post the pic on the discord
[09:08:21]  babsmcnh: oh shit rly?
[09:08:25]  babsmcnh: why not just ask
[09:09:18]  babsmcnh: i'll put the spoiler feature on zetto
[09:09:56]  babsmcnh: haine you in the discord?
[09:10:44]  babsmcnh: death of the character? wtf are you talking about
[09:10:52]  haine_sense1: In Special Relativity (the first one that turned out to be wrong) the light cone is the cone in 4D space time within which it is possible for things to interact
[09:10:55]  babsmcnh: bro i think you got jebaited spoilered
[09:10:58]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL
[09:11:02]  babsmcnh: AHAHAHAHAHA
[09:11:26]  babsmcnh: man i wish i didnt tell you man
[09:11:58]  babsmcnh: whats wrong with that one?
[09:12:13]  haine_sense1: Relativity isn’t really quantum stuff
[09:12:20]  haine_sense1: Quantum is very different
[09:12:26]  babsmcnh: yeah
[09:12:49]  haine_sense1: I’ve only studied special relativity
[09:12:54]  haine_sense1: Not quantum mechanics
[09:13:19]  babsmcnh: i studied a little bit of quantum mechanics
[09:13:24]  haine_sense1: I am now avoiding all physics
[09:13:36]  babsmcnh: its way more atomic for quantum mechanics
[09:13:37]  haine_sense1: Because pure maths is better
[09:13:49]  babsmcnh: relativity is moreso physics right?
[09:13:52]  babsmcnh: as well as math
[09:13:55]  babsmcnh: oh yeah zetto
[09:14:34]  haine_sense1: There are various things:
[09:14:48]  haine_sense1: 1. The applied mathematicians who are actually physicists
[09:15:11]  haine_sense1: 2. The applied mathematicians who aren’t physicists but get on with the physicists
[09:15:18]  babsmcnh: is relativity more like "if a tree falls in the woods then does it make a sound"
[09:15:25]  haine_sense1: 3. The statisticians who do stats
[09:15:46]  babsmcnh: and like the whole if you go in a spaceship for a while time changes
[09:16:07]  babsmcnh: mathematicians using just get funding and are professors
[09:16:10]  babsmcnh: *usually
[09:16:12]  haine_sense1: 4. The pure mathematicians who do mathematical research for companies
[09:16:31]  babsmcnh: what do you wanna do haine
[09:16:41]  haine_sense1: 5. The mathematicians who actually prefer computer science but felt like studying maths to avoid the hardware parts
[09:16:55]  babsmcnh: trueee
[09:17:02]  babsmcnh: i like hardware more though
[09:17:17]  babsmcnh: did a lot of mechanical engineering courses
[09:17:28]  haine_sense1: 6. The mathematicians who become university lecturers and are paid (not enough) to research for universities.
[09:17:37]  babsmcnh: how old are you haine i thought you were like zettos age
[09:18:06]  haine_sense1: 7. The mathematicians who just do it for fun and are only doing a PhD because they don’t want to go into work
[09:18:15]  babsmcnh: "he's in a good school, but he's still in school" LMao
[09:18:29]  babsmcnh: 7. is such a VIBEEEE
[09:18:46]  babsmcnh: haine is just destroying ur question OMEGALUL
[09:19:06]  haine_sense1: 8. The mathematicians who died during their studies due to some health problem because they prioritised maths over living
[09:19:23]  babsmcnh: dont do that haine
[09:19:35]  babsmcnh: also dont become depressed
[09:19:47]  haine_sense1: Ok, I won’t become depressed 👍

[09:44:04]  babsmcnh: even though he ran it
[09:44:40]  chisasfam: Oh so do you hate me
[09:45:06]  chisasfam: Well you know what EMU don’t have to learn owless bc it saves 0 time
[09:45:11]  nightbot: Hit the follow button if you enjoy the stream so you can come back for more! 配信が面白かったらフォローしてね！
[09:45:57]  chisasfam: I don’t know
[09:46:01]  chisasfam: But the time save is very little
[09:46:07]  chisasfam: So people don’t really do it
[09:46:12]  roboplodicus: the tower causes a ton of lag on console but on emu it lags alot less
[09:46:34]  roboplodicus: owless still saves time I think its like 6 seconds
[09:46:40]  chisasfam: And we don’t need to do any leg reduction in DDD
[09:46:55]  chisasfam: @roboplodicus I was told it saved like 1 second o.o
[09:47:26]  musicelliott: You need to stream from a N64 on a black and white TV
[09:47:33]  chisasfam: EMU is that good it has its own category bc it can’t even compare it
[09:47:51]  chisasfam: Are you using CRT or LCD ?
[09:48:41]  roboplodicus: I've heard thats its 0 but I've also heard its like 5 seconds idk but its not much even console players that are decently competitive still don't do owless sometimes
[09:49:33]  roboplodicus: there is also the wii virtual console version I know it has less lag than the n64 I don't knwo how it compares to pc emu though
[09:50:13]  chisasfam: @roboplodicus yeah tbf most EMU switch to N64 when they start to get into top 50-100 ish
[09:51:15]  roboplodicus: *cut out
[09:51:20]  roboplodicus: neutering
[09:51:23]  roboplodicus: is whats its called
[09:51:33]  chisasfam: Vasectomy?
[09:51:46]  roboplodicus: @Chisasfam nah vasectomy is they just cut the tubes
[09:52:12]  roboplodicus: its actually a really minor procedure too
[09:52:25]  roboplodicus: its so you don't have to use birth control
[09:52:37]  roboplodicus: no sperm in the semen
[09:52:51]  chisasfam: Reverse vasectomies don’t have a very high success rate , its still high but not very high
[09:52:59]  chisasfam: And there’s a chance that the tubes can heal back
[09:53:13]  chisasfam: And it’s also not instant sterilisation
[09:53:22]  chisasfam: They’re making a new male birth control yk
[09:53:28]  chisasfam: It’s like a Hot tub for your balls
[09:53:51]  chisasfam: It uses Ultra sound waves to temporary stop sperm
[09:53:59]  roboplodicus: if you already have 4 kids you really don't want ot accidentally get someone pregnant again vasectomy is great
[09:54:08]  roboplodicus: @Chisasfam ball microwave
[09:54:14]  chisasfam: You do it every few weeks , it’s in the testing phase and it was shown to work on mice
[09:54:29]  chisasfam: Ballcuzie
[09:54:47]  babsmcnh: zetto are you going to get a vasectomy
[09:55:08]  kaeos: you should live stream your vasectomy
