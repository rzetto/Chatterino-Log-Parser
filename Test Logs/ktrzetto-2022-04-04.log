[10:20:04]  laurabraus: yeah what usa said
[10:20:04]  saltychildofthesea: PepoG A grimace is a facial expression that usually suggests disgust or pain, but sometimes comic exaggeration.
[10:20:28]  usausachu: Like*
[10:21:32]  laurabraus: "Originally, Grimace was the "Evil Grimace", with two pairs of arms with which to steal milkshakes. After that first campaign, the character was revised to be one of the "good guys", and his number of arms was reduced by two. "
[10:21:34]  laurabraus: LMFAO
