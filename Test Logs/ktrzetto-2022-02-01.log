[05:34:36]  usausachu: Cuz of the emote thingy
[05:34:36]  vptino17: it's like a CoD thing where you just like dive onto the floor
[05:34:37]  usausachu: LMAO
[05:34:59]  babsmcnh: That’s crazy
[05:35:09]  saltychildofthesea: heed my warning daphPain
[05:35:21]  babsmcnh: In order for zetto to stream more he still needs his daily boobies
[05:35:22]  haine_sense1: actually confused what a dolphin dive is

[05:35:39]  vptino17: hannaHi <- who is this?

[05:42:21]  deohang: I came to this stream during the wrong time
[05:42:30]  saltychildofthesea: YEP
[05:42:35]  deohang: Why are you talking about boobas
[05:42:37]  haine_sense1: @DeoHang I was gonna say
[05:43:06]  haine_sense1: @DeoHang because of his 7tv emotes
[05:43:46]  saltychildofthesea: isnt this just reskinned minecraft pixelmon? PunchTrees
[05:43:54]  saltychildofthesea: YEAHBUT7TV
[05:44:25]  haine_sense1: I think it's silly but I don't like seeing them
[05:44:44]  saltychildofthesea: zetto is our subconcious apparently
[05:44:51]  usausachu: Idr
[05:44:55]  usausachu: Oh
[05:44:57]  haine_sense1: carnivore?
[05:44:58]  usausachu: Venus something
[05:45:07]  usausachu: It’s supposed to look like a Venus flytrap idk
[05:45:09]  haine_sense1: carnivine*
[05:45:20]  haine_sense1: I can't remember Pokemon names
[05:45:20]  deohang: Damn I used to type 80085 on my calculator back in the day
[05:45:21]  usausachu: Oh haine is right
[05:45:34]  haine_sense1: as I said before I only get my Pokemon knowledge from hentai
[05:46:02]  haine_sense1: (which is obviously not true given that I know the name of that Pokemon)
[05:46:55]  haine_sense1: as a mathematician, I never wrote 80085 on my calculators
[05:47:29]  haine_sense1: Ok, obviously I wrote it at some point, but like...
[05:47:37]  haine_sense1: I mostly wrote other things
[05:47:46]  saltychildofthesea: as a calculator, i wrote 8008135
[05:48:11]  haine_sense1: cmon, you should write 5318008 and look at it upside down
[05:48:44]  chef_zack: when are later streams coming back
[05:48:47]  haine_sense1: 80085 doesn't come up very often in maths
[05:49:43]  haine_sense1: after all it's 3×5×19×281
[05:49:49]  chef_zack: plupYUMYUM plupYUMYUM plupYUMYUM plupYUMYUM plupYUMYUM plupYUMYUM
[05:49:52]  saltychildofthesea: 282.992932774 is the approximate sqaure root of 80085 PepoG
[05:49:57]  haine_sense1: and we don't like 19 or 281 - they're too large primes
[05:50:15]  haine_sense1: @saltychildofthesea yo, that's quite close to an integer
[05:50:26]  haine_sense1: I wonder what the square above it is
[05:50:40]  saltychildofthesea: its almost 283, but not quite PepePls
[05:50:57]  haine_sense1: 80089
[05:51:01]  haine_sense1: interesting
[05:51:32]  haine_sense1: oh, that means that 3*5*19 = 285
[05:51:35]  haine_sense1: cool
[05:51:48]  saltychildofthesea: HYPERS
[05:52:36]  haine_sense1: pachirisu is cool
[05:52:52]  haine_sense1: was that a bidoof?
[05:52:57]  haine_sense1: yes
[05:52:59]  haine_sense1: I see
[05:53:03]  saltychildofthesea: ok im out ppL /
[05:53:40]  haine_sense1: I always thought they were cute back when I was watching the hentai
[05:54:23]  haine_sense1: what happens when Pokemon attack you?
[05:55:34]  haine_sense1: you have health? woah
[05:55:57]  haine_sense1: when you say die... do you mean faint?
[05:56:02]  haine_sense1: or do you actually die?
[05:56:09]  krystenxo: yo
[05:56:25]  haine_sense1: yo fellow money owner
[05:56:32]  krystenxo: Pretty good, how are you?
[05:56:47]  krystenxo: Hey haine ktrzetHi
[05:56:49]  haine_sense1: maybe because you keep diving everywhere
[05:57:01]  haine_sense1: @krystenxo chicke213Hi jnicWave
[05:57:32]  haine_sense1: how the heck am I still subbed to the guy with the snowman emote?
[05:57:41]  haine_sense1: I haven't watched him in ages
[05:58:03]  haine_sense1: presumably gifts
[05:58:14]  haine_sense1: nah, it won't be auto
[05:58:24]  haine_sense1: I was very careful about who I was subbed to for a while
[05:58:26]  chef_zack: plupYUMYUM
[05:58:57]  haine_sense1: now it's gonna be more difficult to keep track of since I've switched to a payment method that can auto-resub
[05:59:02]  krystenxo: I finally bought this game last night
[05:59:05]  haine_sense1: WE'RE WATCHING YOU

[06:06:31]  haine_sense1: maybe?
[06:06:47]  haine_sense1: I did not know they were supposed to be that small

[06:07:56]  haine_sense1: in terms of power, maybe
[06:08:03]  usausachu: And bidoof
[06:08:28]  haine_sense1: but in terms of just generally approval of pokemon
[06:09:55]  haine_sense1: badly written
[06:09:59]  haine_sense1: I can't write
[06:10:05]  haine_sense1: Caterpie
[06:10:42]  haine_sense1: I mean, better than it's evolution
[06:10:45]  haine_sense1: not the final evolution
