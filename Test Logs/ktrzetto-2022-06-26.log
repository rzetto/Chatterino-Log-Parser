[08:50:16]  robertzarmy: this is financial advice
[08:50:17]  sarahfyi: idk, wouldn't it be better to crypto if you are financially stable? rather than risking it all on super volitilty

[11:00:16]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice.
