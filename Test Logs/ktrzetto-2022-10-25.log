[09:51:42]  chisasfam: but i live in the uk
[09:51:46]  chisasfam: kinda not really
[09:52:00]  chisasfam: Northen independance makes it so the north becomes completely seperate from the south
[09:52:25]  chisasfam: most of the UK industry is from northen cities (Liverpool , York , Manchester ect)
[09:52:26]  shotmaker93: Multiple citizenship?
[09:52:57]  chisasfam: and over half of all the money made In the north goes straight to the south so the north never sees it so thats why the north is super deprived and cheap
[09:53:08]  chisasfam: and the northen independance party wants to stop that
[09:53:39]  chisasfam: I am Brasilian-british by blood , Nationality wise I am Brasilian since I was born in brasil
[09:53:45]  shotmaker93: some country they grant you their citizenship, but you gotta drop your current one...

[09:56:10]  iop4everdudes: hey zetto hope your having a good day man
[09:56:24]  shotmaker93: tough deal living in Japan law, burocracy wise
[09:56:27]  chisasfam: I higkey wanna drop my british citizenship bc im ashamed of it </3
[09:56:56]  chisasfam: The Japanese passport is the strongest passport tho?
[09:57:02]  iop4everdudes: @chisasfam in the EXACT same boat as you
[09:57:24]  chisasfam: @iop4everdudes wanting to drop british citizenship?

[09:59:20]  kaeos: こんばんは！
[09:59:22]  chisasfam: I also didnt care enough for it because I didnt under stand it
[09:59:22]  shotmaker93: i think many ppl who wants to live in Japan they see only the bright side of it..
[09:59:40]  chisasfam: @Shotmaker93 Yeah, You need to research and see all the down sides to it
[10:00:01]  chisasfam: Like at first I was the same like OMG JAPAN IS AMAZING ITS THE BEST PLACE EVER OMG but thats bc thats all that is shown
[10:00:15]  chisasfam: and Ive never met any japanese people say bad things about japan
[10:00:29]  kaeos: do you keep your hair down like that to hide your receding hairline?
[10:00:34]  chisasfam: like if you meet a british person they will say "DO NOT MOVE HERE IT SUCKS"
[10:01:10]  chisasfam: but because ive never met a japanese person who said that I was convinced it was amazing until I did my research, I still wanna live in japan and to me it is still amazing
[10:01:11]  nightbot: Tip me here: https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip

[10:02:02]  chisasfam: I like countries with culture and colour
[10:02:16]  chisasfam: Brasil has so much culture and its just colourful and bright the people are amazing
[10:02:29]  chisasfam: but the uk is just gray and dull and very bland
[10:02:33]  kaeos: i like countries that are america
[10:02:35]  kaeos: KKona
[10:02:37]  shotmaker93: Then why not consider coming back there?
[10:02:47]  chisasfam: japan has alot of culture and I like that
[10:02:47]  shotmaker93: i think would be easier than Japan
[10:02:57]  chisasfam: Brasil Is far too messy for me
[10:03:15]  chisasfam: the biggest issue I have with brasil and the UK is how messy the countries are
[10:03:27]  shotmaker93: in therms of?
[10:03:30]  chisasfam: litter
[10:03:38]  chisasfam: and crime

[10:57:56]  kirosthegreat: well, you'd just look for a those tiny cylinder things - they normally hold a charge to help maintain constant voltage, but after a couple decades, they start leaking out their electrolyte. sometimes they pop, but you usually smell something when that happens. if it's just a blown cap, you can easily fix with a donor board or ordering spares online
[10:58:19]  kaeos: @KirosTheGreat 5Head
[10:58:33]  kaeos: this is a good halloween prank ur putting in way more effort this year than last year
[10:58:37]  kirosthegreat: Yeah, soldering is very likely orooShrug
[10:59:08]  kaeos: u dont have any solder friends?
[10:59:12]  kaeos: i bet rinta solders
[10:59:28]  kaeos: no shot LULW
[10:59:49]  kirosthegreat: But it's also possible, maybe even more likely, that the slot has something built up on the inside that is hindering the connection with the cartridge. if that's the case, cleaning it with alcohol will help
[10:59:57]  kaeos: that was just a random guess im surprised
[11:00:38]  kaeos: are u nutting in ur n64
[11:00:40]  shotmaker93: well is working now...
[11:01:36]  shotmaker93: DansGame
[11:02:41]  kirosthegreat: You'd just need something like 91% isopropyl rubbing alcohol and some lint-free q-tips / cloth. I forgot how tight the pins are on the n64. If there's a 1mm wide gap, a cloth could work with like tooth picks to stuff it in / pull it out
[11:02:56]  kaeos: u should fuck around with it now so you can kill your run sooner rather than later
[11:04:23]  kirosthegreat: Good thing about rubbing alcohol is that it evaporates -very- quickly, and the 9% water that's in the solution is so pure that it isn't electrically conductive, so you don't have to wait long for it to dry
[11:04:46]  kaeos: can you drink rubbing alcohol
[11:05:03]  kirosthegreat: It probably wouldn't be dust, more likely corrosion from the metal-metal contact with a moderate amount of humidity and electricity running through it
[11:05:12]  laurabraus: @kaeos i think you might die
[11:05:20]  kaeos: not me im built different
[11:05:27]  shotmaker93: @kaeos put it on your dick for massive lel
[11:06:13] darkphoeen1x redeemed Sound Alert: 💕Wha～o💕 500
[11:06:15]  kirosthegreat: long use hours aren't something that's typically a problem, but with tech that's been past its prime for decades, it could accumulate and lead to failures
[11:07:17]  darkphoeen1x: i think i have an alt problem in ff14
[11:07:45]  kirosthegreat: yeah, it's pretty common for older consoles like the snes or sega genesis to have bad capacitors. hobbyists replace them all the time so there should be a lot of info online
[11:08:07]  darkphoeen1x: For fun most of them have jokes names
[11:09:11]  kirosthegreat: It's kind of a small miracle that something manufactured in the 90s still works -mostly- as intended. I don't think I own much that's as old as that
[11:09:43]  darkphoeen1x: the lucky thing is i am not in a fc where i have stuff to do
[11:09:48]  shotmaker93: got 2 game boy, my ps2 died.
[11:09:57]  shotmaker93: but ps2 is like 2002
[11:11:36]  kirosthegreat: zetto missing a target as big as a barn makes me feel better about my own lack of skill Kappa
[11:12:17]  kirosthegreat: Edging GlitchNRG
[11:12:30]  shotmaker93: dick in hand wat

[11:13:24]  kirosthegreat: gonna lurk for a bit and catch up on some news, good luck mate rikkuSit
[11:13:49]  darkphoeen1x: causality the green ones which have a cap
[11:14:11]  darkphoeen1x: yup in less than 6 hours
[11:14:23]  shotmaker93: son gonna be do the blanket time*
[11:14:56]  darkphoeen1x: and i eat some instant noodles at this time (4am)
[11:16:05]  darkphoeen1x: can't forget tod o the new beast tribe
[11:19:11]  darkphoeen1x: i think everyone who played sm64 let the baby pinguin "fall" of the cliff
[11:19:36]  darkphoeen1x: Really?
[11:21:24]  kaeos: did u hear japan is opening their borders?
[11:21:35]  kaeos: u should visit sometime
[11:22:21]  kaeos: REAL Japanese guy CRITICIZES Japan YouTuber (Original Concept)
[11:24:02]  kaeos: his missing leg is coming back to haunt him
[11:24:17]  shotmaker93: DansGame
[11:24:57]  laurabraus: "the lag" you mean the ghost cursing your n64
[11:25:04]  kaeos: the mic sounds pretty low today overall
[11:25:49]  kaeos: maybe youre wearing an extra thick mask today
[11:26:00]  shotmaker93: Dog owners who kiss their pet in the mouth or they let themself lick in the face or worse in the mouth, knowing where that tongue has been DansGame
[11:26:40]  kaeos: its not disgusting its beautiful
[11:26:48]  kaeos: its the only way i get an erection anymore
[11:27:23]  shotmaker93: i suspect that would have turned you on i so regret it
[11:29:00]  shotmaker93: don't scam or i deliver your dog to kaeos
[11:30:53]  kaeos: why isnt japan relevant in any major esports
[11:31:29]  shotmaker93: Tekken and some other fighting games
[11:31:59]  kaeos: fighting games arent really major esports
[11:32:07]  shotmaker93: yet the Korean are taking over fucking everything
[11:32:35]  shotmaker93: @kaeos EVO
[11:32:57]  kaeos: evo doesnt compare to the big mobas or shooters
[11:33:07]  shotmaker93: laughable
[11:33:17]  shotmaker93: but whateva
[11:33:37]  kaeos: it doesnt pull nearly the same playerbase or viewership
[11:34:10]  shotmaker93: oh yea were are those numbers, got them in hands right now?
[11:34:55]  kaeos: According to data provided by Esports Charts, Worlds 2021 recorded 1.3m viewers on day one. - esportsinsider.com
[11:35:02]  kaeos: 250K Peak Viewers on EVO 2022 SFV. - @EsportsCharts
[11:35:36]  shotmaker93: lies
[11:36:36]  shotmaker93: raging over a fighting game will always be more entertainment
[11:36:47]  shotmaker93: that alone wins.
[11:38:22]  kaeos: i wish there were salty rage moments in ult that could compare to smash4
[11:38:35]  kaeos: but kiraflax is gone and he was 75% of those compilations
[11:39:05]  kaeos: k9 hangs out with zero these days
[11:39:42]  kaeos: 🤷
[11:39:56]  kaeos: zero pivoted to being part smash and part keemstar
[11:40:03]  kaeos: like he reported on the chess drama i think
[11:42:27]  shotmaker93: Yahoo!
[11:42:35]  kaeos: hans niemann is suing magnus, the japaneseguy whos name i cant type, and chesscom for up to 400mil
[11:43:16]  shotmaker93: ches meh
[11:43:27]  kaeos: yeah he stated the max as 100mil for each party
[11:44:03]  kaeos: the chess scene is worth like 150 or 200mil
[11:44:07]  shotmaker93: checkers is more fun
[11:44:53]  kaeos: checkers is more fun because you dont have to think as hard
[11:44:57]  kaeos: which makes my ego hurt less when i lose
[11:45:44]  kaeos: i have a monopoly ego
[11:46:49]  shotmaker93: risk board game was nice
[11:46:56]  kaeos: clearly not american enough to understand monopoly
[11:47:13]  kaeos: risk is hype asf
[11:47:36]  shotmaker93: don't talk shit about risk
[11:48:41]  kaeos: limp dick throws Sadge

[11:50:04]  kaeos: acola streams on twitch you should collab with him too
[11:50:23]  kaeos: this guy HATES japanese streamers
[11:51:06]  kaeos: they do
[11:51:52]  kaeos: im assuming they only stream on twitch partly because of their team obligations
[11:51:53]  shotmaker93: pingu
[11:52:02]  shotmaker93: weird show that was
[11:53:46]  kaeos: did you think it was a real penguin or something
