[11:36:26]  chisasfam: zetto, question right, why does noone really go "Im good thanks" in japanese
[11:36:39]  chisasfam: in japanese not english obviously ^
[11:36:49]  andrewangus: Pog
[11:36:57]  chisasfam: is it just how the grammar works or do they just assume you're being police
[11:37:23]  chisasfam: polite*
[11:37:39]  rinta_rnt: 金ないのにどうやってピザくうね～ん
[11:37:47]  laurabraus: you could add spinach

[11:38:26]  chisasfam: @laurabraus broccoli is nice but its weird with pasta
[11:38:40]  potatosackhead: pog Pog pOg PoG poG
[11:39:32]  chisasfam: no like when I asked in the japanese learning channel about if its okay to say " げんきですよ。ありがとう "
[11:39:43]  chisasfam: other than it probably being gramatically incorrect
[11:39:48]  potatosackhead: Yo
[11:40:23]  chisasfam: also do I put desu yo at the end of each sentence ? :s
[11:40:58]  chisasfam: ah
[11:41:05]  andrewangus: what would that be in JP
[11:41:20]  chisasfam: but if I put the arigatou at the end its fine? noone would care or would it be weird
[11:41:37]  chisasfam: Im just trying to get a better understanding lol
[11:41:45]  andrewangus: ya
[11:42:04]  laurabraus: usually lessons online will walk you through whats formal and informal

[11:43:42]  rinta_rnt: この間ずっと、ブガッティは一種のベッドや家か何かだと思っていました
[11:44:02]  laurabraus: @Chisasfam this feels really all over the place like nothing would connect because its just random phrases, do you feel like it helped you?

[11:54:24]  usausachu: You should take words you know how to say, and try to frame them in a sentence. Knowing some basic grammar rules @chisasfam then say it out loud, and see if it sounds right. You should be able to tell
