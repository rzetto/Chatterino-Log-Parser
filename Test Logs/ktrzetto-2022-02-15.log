[12:29:09]  maxifyer: 今ベッドに行きます。ここは午前四時です。まったねー！
[12:29:11]  haine_sense1: I read those things
[12:29:17]  hihahaba: I can't read
[12:29:20]  haine_sense1: but I'm a nerd who likes to know exact rules
[12:29:42]  hihahaba: or they just find it annoying
[12:29:54]  robertzarmy: how tf u find pepe annoying
[12:30:07]  nightbot: What's up, local degenerate shillbot here to tell you that if you have Amazon Prime, you can link it with your Twitch account for a free sub!
[12:30:56]  robertzarmy: BOB such a throwback peepoWow
[12:30:57]  haine_sense1: like, I'm also one of probably very few students at Cambridge who bothered to read the network usage policy
[12:31:06] hihahaba redeemed Nico Nico Nii 1000
[12:31:07]  haine_sense1: so, now I just constantly don't follow it
[12:31:17]  chisasfam: I had this really epic kill in bh and ive been looking for it to try and show you but I cant find it bc its a few days old
[12:31:24]  babsmcnh: its so distracting to watch both of you guys
[12:31:26]  hihahaba: clipped
[12:32:20]  haine_sense1: yea, the one that basically tells you not to break the law but also says to use it nearly entirely for academic purposes
[12:32:21]  babsmcnh: hes talking a bunch rn
[12:32:31]  chisasfam: yes youll be like that looks very cool wow brawlhalla is good look at that kill you got woah
[12:32:31]  babsmcnh: my adhd is aiding me though
[12:32:34]  haine_sense1: because universities are killjoys
[12:32:46]  chisasfam: I just have some mediocer clips :((
[12:33:06]  robertzarmy: you will be arrested and executed
[12:33:10]  haine_sense1: yea, in reality, they don't actually care
[12:33:18]  haine_sense1: but it's there for legal purposes
[12:33:53]  robertzarmy: nice bomb clip man peepoWow
[12:33:58]  babsmcnh: okay my adhd is making it worse
[12:34:06]  haine_sense1: the only slightly concerning thing is that they reserve the right to rescind your network access
[12:34:16]  haine_sense1: which would absolutely fuck you over while studying at uni
[12:34:17]  hihahaba: it's a good thing universities don't care I'm trynna retweet squids over here
[12:35:06]  robertzarmy: of course they have the right lmao
[12:35:56]  haine_sense1: the point was more like, they can rescind it entirely if you break that policy, which is true for pretty much ever student
[12:36:28]  haine_sense1: Yea
[12:36:30]  haine_sense1: basically
[12:36:30]  robertzarmy: yeah no shit they can!!!!
[12:36:37]  robertzarmy: they own the network!!!!!
[12:37:18]  haine_sense1: it's more problematic that it says they will if they find you to be breaking the policy which is like, sure that makes sense, but at the same time, eh
[12:37:35]  robertzarmy: can u hit bomb clip
[12:37:41]  robertzarmy: ur just gonna end if u keep missing
[12:38:01]  robertzarmy: I need this
[12:38:07]  robertzarmy: like 10 minutes max and I'm out of here
[12:38:08]  chisasfam: zetto
[12:38:10]  haine_sense1: I mean, I just don't like laws on network usage because there are so many of them that are just "you can't do this thing that is extremely easy to do by accident"
[12:38:13]  chisasfam: I shall shower then bed
[12:38:16]  chisasfam: well "bed"
[12:38:25]  chisasfam: Ill just lay in bed and lurk
[12:38:29]  chisasfam: then sleep
[12:38:41]  chisasfam: but gl on the runs and have a good rest of your day !
[12:38:57]  robertzarmy: gonna accidentally port scan the university and get removed
[12:39:19]  haine_sense1: well, no, that isn't a law as such, but general legal things are annoying wrt network usage and stuff
[12:39:36]  haine_sense1: and I was referring to actual laws as well
[12:39:43]  robertzarmy: that's just how it is
[12:40:00]  robertzarmy: cops could pull you over for going 1mph over the speed limit
[12:40:00]  haine_sense1: well yea
[12:40:09]  robertzarmy: they dont
[12:40:22]  haine_sense1: I'm just commenting on how I don't like laws
[12:40:25]  haine_sense1: in general
[12:40:30]  robertzarmy: we should remove all laws
[12:41:15]  robertzarmy: cringe law tbh
[12:41:25]  babsmcnh: i leave and come back and you're talking about laws?
[12:41:33]  robertzarmy: they want to remove all laws
[12:41:37]  babsmcnh: peepoWTF
[12:41:49]  babsmcnh: laws are there for specific reasons
[12:41:53]  haine_sense1: we never said to remove all laws
[12:41:55]  babsmcnh: imma leave em there
[12:42:05]  haine_sense1: ok, Robert did
[12:42:32]  robertzarmy: we should make port scanning explicitly legal
[12:42:49]  robertzarmy: referendum
[12:43:13]  haine_sense1: what's port scanning mean?
[12:43:20]  robertzarmy: scanning ports
[12:43:31]  haine_sense1: what are ports then?
[12:43:32]  robertzarmy: for vulnerabilities
[12:43:38]  robertzarmy: its a networking thing
[12:43:43]  haine_sense1: ah, I see
[12:43:52]  robertzarmy: it should be legal
[12:44:28]  robertzarmy: it's not illegal either
[12:44:31]  robertzarmy: there's just no law on it

[12:45:13]  haine_sense1: I particularly don't like the law here that says not to access information that people don't intend you to access (even without required malicious intent)
[12:45:33]  robertzarmy: well with penetration testing you get explicit permission from the network owner anyways so a law wouldn't matter then
[12:45:57]  haine_sense1: because like "oops, I used a website that was designed terribly and got lots of information they didn't intend me to get"
[12:46:08]  babsmcnh: i dont like the law that states that i cant be rich
[12:46:10]  robertzarmy: @ktrZetto yo can I get VIP?
