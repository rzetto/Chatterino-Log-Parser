[09:22:40]  haine_sense1: I pay for‚Ä¶ why do I spend more money on streamers than on food?
[09:23:05]  scottief: that is not good
[09:23:30]  haine_sense1: That might be true because of how much I randomly pay streamers and because my mum pays for food while I‚Äôm at home
[09:23:42]  cosmicmikan: as long as you're financially stable, do whatever makes you happy
[09:23:59]  cosmicmikan: life is too short to spend it worrying about what others think
[09:24:36]  kaeos: wow you are bad at this game

[09:28:48]  kaeos: i feel like that doesnt count as rng
[09:28:56]  scottief: some speedruns have rng tho
[09:29:01]  kaeos: its like people who solve rubiks cubes really fast
[09:29:07]  kaeos: same kind of rng
[09:29:45]  haine_sense1: I mean, it would still be skill
[09:29:46]  kaeos: !lurk

[09:48:29]  haine_sense1: This fight daredevil does look somewhat difficult at least
[09:48:43]  haine_sense1: Is that like nerf or nothin‚Äô?
[09:49:53]  kaeos: have you ever overcooked sprite

[09:54:41]  kirosthegreat: I don't think most kids under 6 get soda. At least I didn't. Mind was blown the first time I tried anything carbonated.
[09:55:03]  cosmicmikan: thats so cute lol
[09:55:17]  kaeos: i think every asian guy i know has played tennis

[09:57:24]  haine_sense1: Oh, cool level design
[09:58:00]  laurabraus: awesome
[09:58:14]  kaeos: they say people who are autistic are afraid of change
[09:58:28]  honeybee_darva: Juices often contain just as much sugar. Ye kids get those. Soda manufactures could add vitamins to make them "healthy" but they don't, it's kind of odd both ways.
[09:59:09]  kaeos: is that a mew plushie on your bed
[09:59:28]  kaeos: can i have it
[09:59:33]  haine_sense1: I haven‚Äôt got diabetes, I drank juice pretty much every day since I was a kid
[10:00:06]  cosmicmikan: also depends on your diet overall too
[10:00:18]  haine_sense1: It did slow down time
[10:00:51]  kaeos: high pass filter Pog
[10:02:36]  haine_sense1: Ok, well, it‚Äôs 2am, so I should probably go to sleep now

[10:03:27]  kaeos: we should fund sleeping pills for you
[10:03:30]  kaeos: chat funded
[10:03:52]  haine_sense1: That doesn‚Äôt normally happen
[10:03:57]  haine_sense1: Normally I just keep typing
[10:04:25]  cosmicmikan: rip
[10:04:30]  scottief: bro twitch gives me like a 5 second audio delay from ur video

[10:13:14]  scottief: i dont smoke it tho
[10:13:22]  kaeos: and then i gotta get throug the day on 4 hours of sleep
[10:13:32]  laurabraus: @kaeos same
[10:13:32]  cosmicmikan: the smell would stick to my clothes forever
[10:13:46]  scottief: new orleans smells like weed during mardi gras

[10:30:55]  cosmicmikan: im going to hell anyway, why not add to my list of sins
[10:31:16]  kaeos: i wonder if hell is chill
[10:31:26]  kaeos: like have u seen the comic where they depict satan as chill with sins and lets u run wild
[10:31:46]  cosmicmikan: wonder if theres a gamer hell, and what it'd be like

[10:32:21]  cosmicmikan: forced to play league 24/7
[10:32:29]  kaeos: league players have the most love hate relationship with their game
[10:32:32]  kaeos: except theres no love just hate
[10:32:35]  kaeos: but they play it anyway
[10:32:36]  cosmicmikan: HAHA

[10:57:26]  kaeos: bad RNG
[10:58:21]  kaeos: SO LUCKY
[11:01:00]  rickitarr64: This game looks cool, but it kinda looks like a "Mario 3d world" game rather than a full 3d mario game like 64, odyssey etc.
[11:01:07]  rickitarr64: I guess because it's so linear
[11:01:11]  cosmicmikan: alrighty i gotta bounce! seeya
[11:01:25]  kaeos: bye :)
[11:01:55]  cosmicmikan: <3
[11:02:07]  rickitarr64: right I think that's the point of it

[11:06:47]  kaeos: i knew, as japanese is my native language
[11:08:18]  kaeos: i wish you could exchange bits for dollars irl
[11:08:31]  kaeos: no
[11:08:36]  kaeos: mario galaxy
[11:08:59]  kaeos: but bits are fungible
[11:09:02]  kaeos: nfts are none
[11:09:05]  kaeos: non
[11:10:36]  kaeos: danger, dont fall 4Head
[11:11:59]  kaeos: this level concept is very cool tbh
[11:12:06]  kaeos: props to the game designers
[11:12:35]  kaeos: i like the sand being destroyed and respawning
[11:12:37]  kaeos: mostly that part
[11:15:41]  rickitarr64: prediction!!
[11:21:59]  kaeos: break THIS
[11:23:46]  robertzarmy: how much time is left in this game

[11:24:37]  robertzarmy: zetto said hed play elden ring after this game
[11:24:37]  kaeos: why not
[11:24:40]  kaeos: Pog
[11:25:14]  kaeos: zetto would be so bad at elden ring though he would never finish
[11:26:04]  kaeos: Sadge Jebaited
[11:26:19]  robertzarmy: I've never lied
[11:26:25]  kaeos: you are gaslighting
[11:27:23]  kaeos: rolled
[11:27:28]  robertzarmy: demolished
[11:28:00]  kirosthegreat: Burnt ass probably smells like rump roast.
[11:28:03]  kaeos: you have a channel called "feet" in your viewer list
[11:28:04]  robertzarmy: this area would probably be a good one to farm 900
[11:28:33]  kaeos: yes
[11:28:59]  kaeos: rump roast is a traditional Japanese dish
[11:29:02]  robertzarmy: feet has way more followers than you
[11:29:15]  kirosthegreat: Feet's been in the stream a few times. Can't tell if they're a bot or not.
[11:30:36]  robertzarmy: no vods
[11:31:26]  robertzarmy: i have a 3 letter username in minecraft
[11:31:31]  robertzarmy: cost 900 bucks
[11:33:29]  robertzarmy: i didnt i just sniped it
[11:33:36]  kaeos: it's an NFT
[11:33:43]  robertzarmy: its hard to pay for MC usernames because anyone can take it
[11:34:03]  robertzarmy: theres a 2 week countdown and websites that publicly show the countdown
[11:34:41]  robertzarmy: when you change off your name, there is a 2 week grace period and then after that time is up anybody can take that name as long as they're first
[11:34:55]  kaeos: so u gotta sell the account?
[11:35:06]  robertzarmy: pretty much
[11:35:39]  kaeos: Freudian slip
[11:35:51]  robertzarmy: mm feet
[11:36:19]  robertzarmy: nice kink shame man
[11:36:24]  robertzarmy: weirdo
[11:36:26]  kaeos: it's weird to kink shame
[11:37:42]  kirosthegreat: Ok, so I've been googling feet for the last 15 minutes. I'm pretty sure feet is a novelty account just followed for the meme. Also, I've fallen down a dangerous rabbit hole. Send help.
[11:37:51]  kaeos: ?
[11:38:11]  robertzarmy: TOES
[11:42:29]  kaeos: it knows
[11:48:10]  kaeos: unlucky
[11:53:46]  kaeos: didn't u already beat this game as a young adult
[11:54:17]  kaeos: you can't be that much worse than when you were 24
[11:55:32]  kaeos: old man reflexes
[11:55:58]  kaeos: I wouldn't know I'm just a helper luma
[11:59:02]  kaeos: good night :)
