[10:59:31]  kaeos: just bang the professor FeelsOkayMan
[10:59:49]  babsmcnh: zetto is hellofresh in Japan?
[10:59:53]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice. But if you want to help support the channel, and more importantly, help your boy get paid, feel free to click the link. Please give me your money. https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip https://www.twitch.tv/products/ktrZetto
[11:00:12]  haine_sense1: not really possible: too many examiners to find and bang — some probably won't want it
[11:00:21]  laurabraus: food delivery
[11:00:27]  kaeos: bang them all
[11:00:30]  kaeos: 100% it
[11:00:48]  babsmcnh: I have a free box and if I give it to someone I get a prize
[11:00:57]  babsmcnh: I wanna know that this stupid prize it
[11:00:59]  laurabraus: whats in the box
[11:01:15]  babsmcnh: There’s like 3 planned meals in the box
[11:01:32]  laurabraus: i would say send it to me but i would not eat it
[11:01:36]  babsmcnh: But I think you’d have to sign up and then make sure you cancel it within the week
[11:01:36]  haine_sense1: plus just generally don't think it would be possible since I'm not aware of who the examiners are: I probably have no communication with them, and the exam submissions are partially anonymised
[11:01:38]  babsmcnh: Lmao
[11:02:06]  kaeos: find someone rich to send it to so it doesn't matter if they forget
[11:02:37]  babsmcnh: It says I get a “special prize” I wanna know what’s special about it
[11:02:40]  kaeos: can't you open a po box and send it to yourself
[11:02:51]  babsmcnh: Too lazy
[11:02:55]  babsmcnh: I’ll google it
[11:03:13]  303devilfish: the special prize is me :)
[11:03:19]  kaeos: Pog
[11:04:15]  haine_sense1: I'm not sure if this was a bad idea or not obiyoThink

[11:06:00]  kaeos: Japan tiny baby country... one timezones L :/
[11:07:08]  babsmcnh: Bro the special prize is £5 off Madge
[11:07:11]  kaeos: YO does bunny girl have skype
[11:07:44]  babsmcnh: Waste of my fookin’ time is the stupid prize
[11:07:51]  kaeos: wow these character models are so expressive
[11:08:22]  kaeos: LOL RIP GET FUCKED
[11:08:47]  kaeos: I would never lie on the internet
[11:09:19]  haine_sense1: that was probably a little bit much to eat
[11:09:58]  kaeos: stream the bathroom PogChamp
[11:09:59]  haine_sense1: instead of having one can of food (which claims to have 2 servings in), I mixed 2 cans together
[11:10:27]  babsmcnh: PepePls
[11:10:30]  babsmcnh: Love this song
[11:10:34]  kaeos: this sounds like it would be an anime opening
[11:12:09]  babsmcnh: Yeah it does lol
[11:12:26]  kaeos: what if our world was a game and someone went afk and we had to idle like mikoto for like 100 years
[11:12:30]  kaeos: that would be cool
[11:13:21]  babsmcnh: You telling me I’m not supposed to be constantly idling rn?

But if you want to help support the channel, and more importantly, help your boy get paid, feel free to click the link.

[13:12:54]  kaeos: from what i hear, healers should have the most deaths
[13:16:57]  kaeos: unfortunately, you fell off Sadge
[13:17:57]  kaeos: the healer didnt heal enough
[13:18:18]  haine_sense1: oh, you're still going?
[13:18:34]  haine_sense1: true, only 3 hours
[13:18:44]  kaeos: @Haine_Sense1 are you still british
[13:18:44]  303devilfish: i'm enjoying watching you lose
[13:18:50]  haine_sense1: @kaeos yes
[13:18:52]  kaeos: ew
[13:19:40]  haine_sense1: I can feel that I'm gonna die in the exam today
[13:19:42]  kaeos: did you guys know that the clock isnt called big ben
[13:19:51]  haine_sense1: less than 4 hours til it starts now
[13:20:01]  haine_sense1: I don't drink coffee
[13:20:08]  kaeos: drink lots of gfuel
[13:20:27]  haine_sense1: no, cos tomorrow I have *another* exam and it's at 1:30-5:15
[13:20:27]  kaeos: redbull
[13:20:32]  haine_sense1: in the afternoon
[13:21:02]  haine_sense1: yes, but then how do I be awake for the exam
[13:21:15]  kaeos: does adderall make you more awake
[13:21:23]  haine_sense1: and then again for Friday which I have another exam at 1:30 til 5:15 again
[13:21:41]  kaeos: that doesnt work
[13:21:42]  haine_sense1: I mean, yea, that's probably the only way I can figure out
[13:21:47]  kaeos: thats never worked for me
[13:21:51]  haine_sense1: it doesn't work
[13:21:53]  haine_sense1: but...
[13:21:59]  haine_sense1: it is what is necessary
[13:22:19]  kaeos: TAKE ADDERALL
[13:22:51]  303devilfish: what has my body ever done for me?
[13:22:58]  kaeos: adderall is zetto endorsed :) do it :)
[13:23:14]  haine_sense1: pretty sure he just anti-endorsed it
[13:23:17]  kaeos: the game saw you lose 3 in a row and said you needed plats to carry
[13:23:24]  haine_sense1: yea, I wouldn't be able to get it anyway
[13:23:49]  haine_sense1: oh it's for adhd
[13:23:52]  kaeos: how can you not find adderall on a college campus in any major city
[13:23:53]  haine_sense1: I see
[13:23:56]  kaeos: thats impossible
[13:23:56]  haine_sense1: it's that one
[13:24:51]  haine_sense1: @kaeos it being prescription means you have to get it prescribed to you by a doctor to get it
[13:24:54]  haine_sense1: so like... no
[13:25:15]  kaeos: i bet i could find adderall here easily
[13:26:09]  kaeos: plat 1v5 GIGACHAD
[13:26:44]  haine_sense1: apparently I can't legally possess adder all without a prescription
[13:26:50]  haine_sense1: adderall*
[13:27:08]  303devilfish: go in with them so it's 2v5
[13:27:16]  kaeos: 5Head
[13:27:38]  kaeos: wait yeah if you go in with them and its 2v5, another teammate would make it 3v5 and so on
[13:27:42]  kaeos: holy 5Head
[13:29:34]  haine_sense1: but what if you go in 1v5 and you win?
[13:29:40]  kaeos: true
[13:29:45]  kaeos: just win the 1v5 ??
[13:30:13]  haine_sense1: well anyway, I'm gonna rest for a bit
[13:30:16]  kaeos: as the healer, you should be able to win the 1v5 as you have unlimited health
[13:30:31]  haine_sense1: no
[13:30:44]  haine_sense1: I'm gonna sleep/rest eyes til like 8am
[13:30:58]  kaeos: 20 bucks he falls asleep and misses the exam
[13:31:24]  haine_sense1: @kaeos that has happened before but not for an exam
[13:31:24]  kaeos: that would be funny asf
[13:31:29]  kaeos: ive done it before
[13:31:30]  haine_sense1: yea, I don't think I'm gonna miss it
[13:31:54]  haine_sense1: exactly my body does it for me most of the time
[13:32:10]  kaeos: to test that, you should go to sleep without an alarm
[13:32:30]  haine_sense1: the only times it doesn't work is if I end up trying to get in like 20 minutes of eye rest before something
[13:32:35]  haine_sense1: then I fail completely
[13:32:56]  haine_sense1: or if I'm extremely low on sleep and just actually have no energy
[13:33:03]  haine_sense1: but I'm not extremely low on sleep
[13:33:10]  haine_sense1: I expected not to need to sleep
[13:33:36]  kaeos: youre about to start getting games with bronzes LULW
[13:33:39]  haine_sense1: I'm just adding a bit of extra rest so I'm not super tired by the end of the 3:45 h:mm of the exam
[13:34:00]  haine_sense1: so yea, enjoy rest of stream
[13:34:04]  kaeos: gn :)

[13:35:07]  kaeos: this guy has a degree?
[13:35:35]  haine_sense1: there's just no freaking standardised shorthand for times like that
[13:35:52]  kaeos: i think your hair is taking over the space where your brain is supposed to be
[13:36:23]  haine_sense1: but yea, now that's been explained
[13:36:25]  haine_sense1: zzz
[13:36:34]  kaeos: h obviously stands for hours and mm because minute has two m's
[13:36:42]  kaeos: wait no

[13:37:58]  kaeos: no i knew it i was clearly pretending

[13:43:32]  kaeos: gimr is poor OMEGALUL
[13:43:58]  kaeos: why do you think he's bald?
[13:44:03]  kaeos: because he cant afford haircuts
[13:47:41]  kaeos: i wouldnt be shocked if acola didnt make top 8 too
[13:47:55]  kaeos: Sadge lost the first fight
[13:48:11]  kaeos: yeah
[13:48:36]  kaeos: 1-10 today Sadge
[13:49:08]  kaeos: yeah i think first time international, hazards stagelist, sparg0 best cloud, and NA players are more consistent than JP players imo
[13:49:16]  kaeos: all of that makes me think he's gonna underperform
[13:49:28]  kaeos: yeah
[13:50:05]  kaeos: well off the top of my head anyway
[13:50:21]  kaeos: the only super inconsistent one imo there is tweek
[13:51:32]  kaeos: i feel like tea is the only super consistent player when hes in NA
[13:51:38]  kaeos: and zackray when he played
[13:52:15]  kaeos: i want zackray to come back
[13:52:19]  kaeos: i think he'd easily be number 1
[13:52:21]  kaeos: in jp
[13:52:41]  kaeos: proto fell off
[13:52:45]  kaeos: i was a proto simp
[13:53:10]  kaeos: gn have a good week :)
