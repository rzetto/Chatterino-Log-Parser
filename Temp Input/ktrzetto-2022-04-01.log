[11:47:09]  hihahaba: the joysticks are linear and looser
[11:47:17]  miyashirotomoko101: OKi
[11:47:19]  hihahaba: and my face buttons are mouseclick buttons
[11:47:37]  miyashirotomoko101: I only know hello and bye
[11:48:14]  miyashirotomoko101: but I got a teacher thats teaching me
[11:48:26]  hihahaba: rn I got a cherry blue in my left trigger and cherry clear in my right
[11:48:38]  hihahaba: also the z button's tactile
[11:48:43]  kaeos: ?
[11:49:08]  hihahaba: I just switched the left one from clear today lol
[11:49:33]  hihahaba: the specific for joystick is swapping the OEM spring for a wavespring
[11:49:40]  hihahaba: and then you can control the tension with shims
[11:51:18]  hihahaba: yeah I've seen a couple n64 stuff since I've gotten active in controller modding
[11:51:27]  hihahaba: the steel gate/stick is an interesting
[11:51:32]  hihahaba: *interesting one
[11:51:44]  hihahaba: apparently that with the right lube makes the n64 stick a lifetime machine
[11:52:04]  hihahaba: cause the actual mechanism's good it's just the material they built it out of isn't durable
[11:54:05]  hihahaba: rn the big lifetime bottleneck for gamecube controllers is the potentiometers
[11:54:20]  hihahaba: there's an opensource hall effect sensor getting developed rn it's sick
[11:54:57]  hihahaba: *hall effect sensor board
[11:54:58]  kaeos: 5Head
[11:55:21]  hihahaba: uuuuh instead of using a physical carbon track that can degrade mechanically it uses magnets
[11:56:08]  kaeos: but magnets weaken over time
[11:56:30]  hihahaba: potentiometers last for months under heavy usage
[11:56:50]  hihahaba: the magnets will only get weak enough for that to be problematic after like 100 years lol
[11:57:02]  kaeos: are you not gonna be playing smash in 100 years?
[11:57:02]  hihahaba: the carbon track thing for your joystick
[11:57:21]  hihahaba: point is the joystick input won't be the bottleneck anymore
[11:57:50]  hihahaba: also hall effect sensors not degrading with usage means no PODE which another can of worms altogether
[11:58:16]  kaeos: why dont you know what this all means
[11:58:19]  kaeos: dont you work in IT
[11:58:37]  hihahaba: I don't work in IT
[11:58:40]  kaeos: cringe
[11:58:56]  hihahaba: I just took college physics
[11:59:30]  kaeos: i was the only person who got a 100 on my physics midterm
[11:59:31]  kaeos: not to flex

[12:01:09]  hihahaba: that or I either never noted it
[12:01:10]  kaeos: next life ur getting resurrected as a fruit fly or something
[12:02:07]  kaeos: i would like to be resurrected as elon musks child
[12:02:29]  kaeos: having a shitty name is worth billions
[12:02:37]  hihahaba: I would like to resurrected as Elon Musk so I can benefit off of child labor and emerald mines
[12:02:39]  kaeos: even if he names me something in those weird symbols
[12:03:16]  kaeos: a million is nothing tho
