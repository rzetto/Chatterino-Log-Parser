[10:16:30]  crab_father: Pizza Pizza KonCha
[10:16:45]  crab_father: How are you today bro?
[10:17:13]  crab_father: Oh?
[10:17:18]  crab_father: What happened
[10:17:35]  crab_father: I’m ok but I got some what I suspect are oil burns on my feet
[10:18:02]  crab_father: Yes
[10:18:24]  crab_father: Also yes
[10:18:33]  crab_father: I was using like a oil screen
[10:18:44]  crab_father: To catch the oil when it came out
[10:19:03]  crab_father: But it got so saturated with oil that when I moved it
[10:19:24]  crab_father: It’s like a wire mesh you place over the pan
[10:19:55]  crab_father: Yes
[10:20:17]  crab_father: I moved it and a bunch spilled on me foor
[10:20:24]  crab_father: Foot*
[10:20:57]  crab_father: A lot of burgers
[10:21:11]  crab_father: I need to just switch to cooking in butter
[10:21:47]  crab_father: Same atm
[10:22:15]  crab_father: Was popping so much it sounded like the area near your old dorm
[10:22:49]  crab_father: Personally I enjoy cooking for others more than myself
[10:23:40]  crab_father: I’m an American I just cook a lot
[10:23:53]  crab_father: And boom leftovers for another day
[10:24:10]  crab_father: :O
[10:25:44]  crab_father: That’s fair
[10:25:57]  crab_father: There a lot like that here as well
[10:26:08]  crab_father: How’s the economy fairing?
[10:26:32]  crab_father: Japan
[10:27:02]  crab_father: True
[10:27:17]  crab_father: Stock market is a poor indicator in my opinion
[10:27:24]  crab_father: But I’m no economist
[10:27:32]  303devilfish: peepoArrive
[10:29:16]  crab_father: I think that there are a lot of problems here that aren’t solved by job creation
[10:29:28]  crab_father: Since part time positions are counted
[10:29:43]  crab_father: Despite being unlivable
[10:32:00]  crab_father: Tbh I know it still sounds dumb, but really there are astronomical amounts of money that are controlled by the same top boards
[10:32:37]  303devilfish: we live in a society
[10:32:47]  crab_father: It’s the investors and companies
[10:33:02]  crab_father: The average man has little pull economically
[10:33:20]  crab_father: Politicians in the US are mostly in corporate pockets
[10:33:28]  crab_father: Idk how it is in JP
[10:33:45]  crab_father: Ok that might help a little
[10:34:21]  crab_father: Wait
[10:34:26]  crab_father: 0%
[10:34:30]  crab_father: ???????
[10:34:54]  crab_father: I didn’t even know that
[10:35:19]  crab_father: The gamble gets cut
[10:36:17]  crab_father: Yeah
[10:36:33]  crab_father: True
[10:38:59]  crab_father: Wowza
[10:39:55]  crab_father: You aren’t wrong
[10:40:33]  crab_father: Personally I tend to keep away from political affiliation, since it’s gotten to polarized
[10:40:42]  crab_father: True USA stole the worlds gold
[10:40:45]  crab_father: In like
[10:40:53]  crab_father: World war 1?
[10:40:57]  crab_father: I think
[10:41:32]  crab_father: Good old usa
[10:41:50]  crab_father: Get out monied I guess?
[10:42:51]  crab_father: It’s hard to break into the American market
[10:43:19]  crab_father: At least morally
[10:43:48]  crab_father: There is
[10:44:03]  crab_father: I think nestle sponsors Somali pirates I think
[10:45:03]  crab_father: Yes
[10:45:23]  crab_father: Dude like major companies commit straight war crimes
[10:46:00]  crab_father: They still do that
[10:47:09]  crab_father: Fruit companies caused a coup in the southern islands
[10:47:32]  crab_father: Nestle would poison water supplies to villages
[10:47:39]  crab_father: Then sell them water
[10:47:51]  crab_father: They also poisoned babies for profit
[10:48:06]  crab_father: I’m being serious
[10:48:18]  crab_father: They are like fucking super villains
[10:48:29]  crab_father: Twiddling their mustache
[10:48:43]  parkgimbap: merry christmas eve Mr Zetto peepoBlanket
[10:49:24]  crab_father: Remember the drought in cali?
[10:49:49]  crab_father: They were stealing billions of gallons of water
[10:50:03]  303devilfish: california's basically in a perpetual drought
[10:50:44]  crab_father: They stole 210 million gallons annually over 20 years or smth
[10:51:08]  crab_father: Since 2003
[10:51:12]  crab_father: Maybe before
[10:51:14]  crab_father: Unclear
[10:53:50]  parkgimbap: i think it's starting to make sense. you lost your wisdom tooth so you lost some skills
[10:56:02]  parkgimbap: did you have to stay awake or were you able to get knocked out during the procedure?
[10:57:20]  crab_father: I hear they smack you with a comically large radish
[10:58:02]  303devilfish: the one i had removed was coming in sideways so they had to crack it into pieces like an eggshell and suck it out
[10:58:07]  303devilfish: :)
[11:03:25]  parkgimbap: sounds to me like you were blessed with good luck
[11:03:42]  parkgimbap: so i'm assuming you didn't get any swollen cheeks
[11:03:43]  crab_father: What?!?!
[11:03:46]  crab_father: Ayo
[11:03:54]  crab_father: I’m bout a fly out
[11:04:02]  crab_father: Might be cheaper in the long run
[11:04:02]  kaeos: LEARN FRAMEWALK OR I UNFOLLOW
[11:04:23]  kaeos: 120 star
[11:05:15]  kaeos: so no framewalk?
[11:05:28]  kaeos: : (
[11:06:32]  kaeos: that's crazy
[11:06:35]  crab_father: So no head?
[11:06:41]  crab_father: SMH
[11:07:15]  kaeos: wtf is this weeb music
[11:07:24]  kaeos: oh wait he's Japanese I forgot
[11:09:25]  303devilfish: make your bed Madge
[11:09:36]  kaeos: lil bro fell in the toilet
[11:11:16]  303devilfish: YEP
[11:11:21]  kaeos: you already don't
[11:11:49]  303devilfish: NOTED ignoring medical advice
[11:11:52]  kaeos: what did u jerk off to
[11:11:57]  kaeos: that's important to know
[11:12:46]  303devilfish: YEP
[11:15:38]  kaeos: did you know that it's already Christmas in Australia
[11:15:53]  kaeos: no
[11:16:28]  kaeos: I know I thought it was weird too at first but they actually celebrate Christmas on the 24th in Australia
[11:16:58]  kaeos: the more u know
[11:17:28]  kaeos: they celebrate the day Mary's water broke and not the day Jesus was born in Australia
[11:18:03]  kaeos: yeah those wacky Australians
[11:18:55]  303devilfish: cuz new year is when we complete a cycle around the sun
[11:19:07]  kaeos: the new year has nothing to do with Jesus
[11:19:31]  kaeos: it's the year after Christ
[11:20:16]  kaeos: yes
[11:21:01]  303devilfish: the earth would explode
[11:21:05]  kaeos: because then it would not be 1 year around the sun, it would be 1 year and 6 days
[11:22:05]  kaeos: so you want a year to be 359 days?
[11:23:05]  kaeos: I feel like this conversation is making me dumber
[11:24:57]  kaeos: wouldn't you need to rewrite all history for that
[11:26:30]  kaeos: because like for all of history the new year was the first and then Jesus was born on the 25th relative to the first so you're saying from that point they should have just made the new year the 25th?
[11:27:16]  kaeos: since 800BC
[11:27:18]  303devilfish: the gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582
[11:28:23]  kaeos: speedrunning is just a scapegoat you wouldn't know either way
[11:29:12]  kaeos: kill the run rn
[11:29:14]  kaeos: pussy
[11:29:20]  303devilfish: COPIUM
[11:30:06]  vel0cicraptor: he doesnt even go pillarless smh
[11:31:45]  303devilfish: FeelsGoodMan clintR
[11:31:49]  kaeos: wait so if they made the 25th the start of the new year, then Jesus would need to have been born on the 19th bc the new year signifies 1 trip around the sun and Jesus will always have been born 6 days before that
[11:33:02]  kaeos: bro called our lord and savior lil jc 😭
[11:33:36]  kaeos: if you're not a heathen you would
[11:34:20]  kaeos: sinful infidel
[11:34:52]  vel0cicraptor: have u ever been to arkansas? pretty much the same as hell
[11:35:10]  kaeos: you speedrun and reset it halfway every day you're basically reenacting Sisyphus
[11:36:08]  kaeos: is it r/Arkansas or r/kansas
[11:37:18]  kaeos: r/arkansaw?
[11:37:39]  kaeos: it is

[11:41:43]  kaeos: I don't want to live in Kansas
[11:42:39]  vel0cicraptor: 1. Delaware
[11:42:40]  kaeos: montana
[11:43:07]  kaeos: but if I went to Greenland they have snow
[11:43:31]  kaeos: Canada is just America lite
[11:43:34]  vel0cicraptor: there is snow in arkansas
[11:44:35]  kaeos: also Greenland will probably be safe after WW3
[11:45:00]  kaeos: if I have snow I can live off of snow cones
[11:45:51]  kaeos: the fish will all be dead or unsafe for consumption after nuclear fallout
[11:47:47]  kaeos: you'll probably be dead
[11:48:12]  kaeos: don't let that get you down though
[11:48:24]  vel0cicraptor: hey kaeos guess what
[11:48:27]  kaeos: you'll get to experience great advancements in VR porn before you go

[11:52:15]  kaeos: the telekineses would be so powerful something could finally lift yo mama LOL
[11:53:01]  kaeos: that wasn't actually funny but I put LOL at the end hoping it would make it funny
[11:53:26]  kaeos: the neuralink makes you last longer in bed
[11:53:41]  vel0cicraptor: cite one (1) source for that
[11:54:11]  kaeos: I bet it could do that
[11:54:30]  vel0cicraptor: source: pulled it out of his ass
[11:54:36]  kaeos: it'll eventually make humans stupid and codependent on it
[11:55:21]  vel0cicraptor: imagine how easy it would be to take over the world when you have an entire army of zogdrones who willingly paid money for you to put a chip in their brain
[11:55:39]  kaeos: it kills thousands of animals in testing
[11:56:19]  kaeos: can I get a huge prosthetic dick
