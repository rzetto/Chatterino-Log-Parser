[11:18:02]  meetothis: Sam also funded almost $30 million for bidens run
[11:18:41]  meetothis: Yeah it‚Äôs just a rumour, but apparently the 10 people in the inner circle are apparently romantically involved
[11:18:43]  shotmaker93: by the time he's done is service he will have more than that
[11:19:05]  meetothis: The Canadian pension fund lost $80 million
[11:20:24]  meetothis: My term deposit is 4% it‚Äôs to match inflation, cash rates are like 3% so interest needs to be above that

[11:55:33]  meetothis: All followers of the FSM hold that pirates are sacred and were the first Pastafarians. Climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters are directly linked to the declining number of pirates worldwide. Many Pastafarians therefore choose to wear full pirate regalia as a means to help the environment and belay natural disasters. Other Pastafarians just like wearing colanders on their heads.
