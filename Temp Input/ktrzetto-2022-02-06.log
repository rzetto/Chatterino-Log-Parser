[06:43:29]  haine_sense1: ya know that image people have of middle aged people having a mid-life crisis and just drinking their sorrows away?
[06:43:52]  haine_sense1: oh
[06:44:00]  haine_sense1: not a video
[06:44:04]  haine_sense1: I just meant general concept
[06:44:22]  haine_sense1: no
[06:45:27]  haine_sense1: no, not the perception, I'm basically just commenting on people drinking to avoid life
[06:46:04]  haine_sense1: oh, just saying I seem to be doing that but not with alcohol, with twitch
[06:46:37]  haine_sense1: not midlife of course
[06:46:38]  haine_sense1: but ya
[06:47:00]  haine_sense1: well yea, that's true
[06:48:43]  haine_sense1: rn, the only things I actually care about are watching certain streamers, and climbing.
[06:49:01]  haine_sense1: The above is wrong since there is definitely something to do with maths that I enjoy and care about
[06:49:08]  haine_sense1: but I don't know what it is
[06:51:59]  haine_sense1: honestly, all I'm saying is that I wish I could find doing example sheets less taxing

[07:01:17]  nightbot: What's up, local degenerate shillbot here to tell you that if you have Amazon Prime, you can link it with your Twitch account for a free sub!

[07:02:30]  haine_sense1: covid literally can't get to you
[07:02:41]  haine_sense1: (I mean, it could, but that's not the point)
[07:02:56]  haine_sense1: I know really obviously lol
[07:02:56]  krystenxo: Honestly I‚Äôd ban someone like that too
[07:03:29]  haine_sense1: yea, but masks don't prevent from getting covid that much I think
[07:03:30]  chef_zack: EZ sniped
[07:03:51]  haine_sense1: pretty sure it's more to reduce spread from you
[07:04:03]  chef_zack: tf

[07:04:29]  chef_zack: thats like obvious blackmail
[07:04:50]  haine_sense1: they were right about one thing though. you're cute ;)
[07:05:32]  efrye684: I just noticed, is seriously every chatter here subscribed? That's some great conversion^^
[07:05:34]  haine_sense1: haha sounds likely that they were doing it to other people too
[07:05:49]  haine_sense1: @Efrye684 not everyone, but quite a few
[07:06:00]  haine_sense1: there aren't that many chatters in the first place lol
[07:06:03]  chef_zack: mf ransom fee
[07:06:31]  haine_sense1: yea, blackmail requires them to have something they could share
[07:07:01]  haine_sense1: yea, my current one is a gift
[07:07:19]  haine_sense1: which probably makes up for the amount of money I've given you recently
[07:07:20]  krystenxo: Yeah it was an accident for me to sub to zetto so
[07:07:24]  haine_sense1: to some extent
[07:07:28]  krystenxo: LMAO kidding
[07:07:56]  haine_sense1: cmon it was only 50$
[07:08:06]  haine_sense1: that's not *that* much
[07:08:13]  krystenxo: Oh yeah I did that too
[07:08:19]  haine_sense1: if I wanted to I could give you 500
[07:08:41]  haine_sense1: I don't want to because that would be *waaaayyyy* too much
[07:08:58]  chef_zack: only 50$
[07:09:23]  haine_sense1: I'm just saying I *could*
[07:09:27]  haine_sense1: oh wow
[07:09:30]  haine_sense1: I really don't want to then
[07:09:36]  haine_sense1: I need you to stay here lol
[07:09:49]  chef_zack: sorry i forgot to BatChest , 50 is alot of money
[07:11:29]  haine_sense1: is a juju an omen?
[07:12:35]  haine_sense1: oh apparently it probably comes from a word meaning evil spirit or fetish
[07:12:49]  chef_zack: no
[07:12:51]  haine_sense1: no, I don't watch anything by you
[07:12:58]  haine_sense1: why would we watch that

[10:58:57]  laurabraus: one of my friends was selling her feet pics for a while

[10:59:44]  laurabraus: it is low
[11:00:01]  robertzarmy: the part of the brain that processes genital arousal is next door to the part of our brain that processes the sensation people get from feet

[11:01:15]  robertzarmy: its not all foot fetishes but it can be the case for some
[11:01:22]  haine_sense1: wait, is that why your feet are so ticklish or is that just cos they need to be able to sense things a lot
[11:01:29]  laurabraus: but even if the physical sensation is next door the visual stimuli of seeing a foot isnt
[11:02:29]  robertzarmy: google it
[11:02:38]  robertzarmy: i heard some doctor youtuber say it once so it must be right
[11:02:59]  efrye684: You better PB this run, all this foot fetish talk would go to waste otherwise D:
[11:03:01]  haine_sense1: @robertzarmy makes sense
[11:03:07]  haine_sense1: @Efrye684 hahaha
[11:03:14]  haine_sense1: sadge
[11:03:24]  efrye684: Sadge
[11:03:36]  robertzarmy: imagine the pb vod just had zetto showing his feet in it
[11:03:40]  haine_sense1: more example of me not remembering capital letters for emotes
[11:04:01]  haine_sense1: @robertzarmy would be amazing but it was gonna be between attempts
[11:05:56]  robertzarmy: what if it was a sub 1hour
[11:06:41]  robertzarmy: ill gift 100 subs if u get WR this run
[11:07:04]  robertzarmy: yeah exactly
[11:07:07]  robertzarmy: i dont want to gift 100 subs
[11:07:27]  robertzarmy: you're pointless
[11:07:30]  robertzarmy: bitch
[11:07:46]  chef_zack: circles
[11:08:20]  haine_sense1: how long do you think it'll be before everyone gives up on saving earth?
[11:08:26]  chef_zack: probably not
[11:08:28]  chef_zack: they might live longer
[11:08:38]  haine_sense1: they'll experience time the same way
[11:08:48]  chef_zack: i dont think everyone has
[11:09:31]  haine_sense1: but there's a chance they might have something that allows them to bend spacetime to the point that they can actually move somewhat freely through it
[11:09:34]  chef_zack: Pog i heard about her in my class
[11:09:49]  haine_sense1: we are absolutely fucked
[11:10:05]  chef_zack: custom wormhole
[11:10:50]  haine_sense1: lol
[11:10:54]  haine_sense1: america is too large
[11:10:54]  chef_zack: true
[11:11:34]  haine_sense1: if we had custom wormholes, then privacy would be incredibly difficult to manage
[11:12:23]  haine_sense1: unless they require devices at either end of the wormhole which would probably make sense
[11:13:15]  haine_sense1: yes, but if the technology existed, then clearly people would want to try to make them
[11:13:57]  haine_sense1: lol
[11:13:59]  haine_sense1: that's true lol
[11:14:36]  haine_sense1: the other slightly concerning thing about wormholes is that I've only ever heard about them from the perspective of black holes
[11:14:46]  haine_sense1: which kinda suggests they're really dangerous
[11:15:15]  pulsejp: Sadge
[11:15:54]  haine_sense1: just have a cup of water and a towel
[11:16:17]  haine_sense1: yea basically
[11:16:45]  haine_sense1: water's good for getting rid of sweat and towel's good for getting rid of water
[11:16:57]  haine_sense1: I normally wash my hands to dry my hands for climbing
[11:17:12]  haine_sense1: if I can't be bothered to get chalk
[11:17:35]  haine_sense1: no
[11:17:45]  haine_sense1: I mean, actually, what is baby powder
[11:17:50]  haine_sense1: since there's a chance that they're similar
[11:18:01]  haine_sense1: since chalk definitely isn't actual chalk
[11:18:32]  chef_zack: i thought it was similar to baking powder
[11:18:59]  chef_zack: you watched the boss baby
[11:19:00]  haine_sense1: so you didn't learn it because you wanted a child?
[11:19:04]  chef_zack: POGGERS
[11:19:22]  haine_sense1: seems fair lol
[11:19:27]  chef_zack: im getting myself a mf vasectomy asap
[11:20:10]  haine_sense1: I feel like having a child nowadays is kinda like going "let's bring a new person into life just so their future is fucked up"
[11:20:53]  haine_sense1: no I didn't hear that since I don't watch clint
[11:20:55]  haine_sense1: or liam
[11:21:04]  efrye684: amazing xD
[11:21:37]  haine_sense1: no you're literally super good looking
[11:21:43]  haine_sense1: like honestly
[11:22:15]  haine_sense1: I would say more but that would be weird
[11:22:20]  haine_sense1: I mean it's already weird
[11:22:37]  haine_sense1: idk
[11:22:41]  haine_sense1: they're losing out
[11:22:49]  efrye684: at KFC probably
[11:23:05]  haine_sense1: *makes a trap snapchat account*
[11:23:23]  laurabraus: all my snaps are squireels
[11:23:37]  laurabraus: so many

[11:28:32]  laurabraus: it just feels weird sharing any real moment of my life LMAO
[11:28:33]  haine_sense1: yeah I follow you on there already
[11:28:45]  haine_sense1: it's not like it makes any difference since you don't post
[11:28:46]  laurabraus: and posting selfies all the time feels bad
[11:28:55]  laurabraus: exactly
[11:29:08]  laurabraus: i should make an aesthetic account
[11:29:21]  haine_sense1: no, you don't see likes on insta
