[09:09:36]  303devilfish: FeelsStrongMan
[09:11:11]  zeroultima6: i believe there are 5-6 endings in this game
[09:12:00]  zeroultima6: and some of them are excluive
[09:13:02]  zeroultima6: you're on the Omori route now
[09:14:05]  zeroultima6: since the Omori has 3-4 endings
[09:14:13]  zeroultima6: route*
[09:14:28]  zeroultima6: the other 2.....
[09:15:23]  zeroultima6: is only on the Hikikkomori route

[09:23:25]  zeroultima6: and the value increase
[09:24:55]  zeroultima6: no, over here is a similar thing
[09:25:40]  303devilfish: KKona evoUSA Clap
[09:26:18]  zeroultima6: the dollar devalues because of printing money for different reasons
[09:27:05]  kaeos: stimulate THIS
[09:27:17]  zeroultima6: but sometimes...
[09:27:42]  zeroultima6: you don't bail them out
[09:28:00]  zeroultima6: let them fall and we rebuild
[09:28:17]  303devilfish: ayo the pizza here
[09:29:47]  kaeos: is this hasan piker?
[09:30:19]  kaeos: no its fine personally i hate poor people
[09:30:44]  yourcrazym8: @kaeos that's weird but ok
[09:31:36]  kaeos: when u cover all the bases like that my hands are tied
[09:32:15]  zeroultima6: and what happens when big companies fall?

[09:35:48]  zeroultima6: basil...
[09:35:57]  303devilfish: D:
[09:35:57]  nightbot: D:
[09:36:26]  303devilfish: playing through the whole game again just to make Basil suffer more FeelsWeirdMan
[09:36:32]  zeroultima6: that's the neutral ending
[09:38:07]  kaeos: is there an ending where you just move away normally like it would happen in real life
[09:38:07] ブライトくん bright_f4: Top G, What color is your Bugatti? 🚗🚙🚘
[09:38:33]  zeroultima6: and now basil's something is haunting you
[09:40:11]  kaeos: i like this ending
[09:40:19]  kaeos: does basil kill himself in this ending
[09:40:22]  kaeos: why are there sirens
[09:40:35]  kaeos: oh i like it less
[09:40:37]  303devilfish: i think the sirens imply you kill yourself too but i'm not sure
[09:41:54]  kaeos: why was toby fox in the credits
[09:42:02]  kaeos: i hated undertale
[09:43:03]  kaeos: why do ultimate players like hungrybox so much
[09:44:21]  kaeos: if it were me, i would like with that
[09:44:56]  zeroultima6: why's a knife?
[09:46:52]  kaeos: hey pick up the phone
[09:47:29]  kaeos: this ending is for pussies

[09:49:33]  303devilfish: PepePls 🔥
[09:51:09]  303devilfish: Bedge
[09:51:33]  zeroultima6: sometimes, looking up youtube is a bit lazy
[09:53:04]  laurabraus: nah aint nobody got time to go through extra endings if you can look them up on youtube
[09:53:23]  303devilfish: PepePls
[09:53:24]  laurabraus: especially if its like. you'd have to play the whole game again
[09:55:34]  303devilfish: FeelsStrongMan
[09:57:39]  laurabraus: clap clap clap
[09:57:42]  kaeos: i no longer respect you as a true omori fan, for not playing through all the alternative endings
[09:57:43]  303devilfish: FeelsStrongMan Clap
