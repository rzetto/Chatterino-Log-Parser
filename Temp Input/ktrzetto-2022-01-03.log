[15:07:49]  clouds617: except snape kills dumbledore cause everyone likes to meme that
[15:07:55]  clouds617: THE meme spoiler
[15:08:39]  clouds617: I do remember some part where harry snaps his forearm and they give him medicine that makes it all bendy
[15:08:46]  chef_zack: i mean, these books/movies are like 15/20 years old
[15:08:49]  cosmicmikan: i had the biggest crush on snape and malfoy as a kid. well more like their actors
[15:09:54]  clouds617: Ive been missing out on so much pop culture not watching these movies lol
[15:10:14]  clouds617: I dont know for sure but harry potter has to be one of the top 5 selling books in america
[15:10:39]  clouds617: lol according to the first result on google its #5 exactly
[15:11:15]  clouds617: goblet of fire is a behemoth
[15:11:36]  twistedgm: I don't really like Harry Potter, though.
[15:11:40]  cosmicmikan: pls dont remind me of that garbage
[15:11:41]  clouds617: the later books are easily 700-800 something I think
[15:11:49]  clouds617: longest book ive ever read was 500
[15:11:52]  cosmicmikan: even i was not immune to twilight

[15:21:13]  chef_zack: romance modCheck

[15:21:29]  chef_zack: no its my favourite
[15:21:38]  clouds617: it doesnt pay to end your story when you can just keep releasing it
[15:21:43]  cosmicmikan: ooh i read that
[15:21:44]  cosmicmikan: i liked it
[15:21:45]  kaeos: I've seen GATE, it's good
[15:21:50]  cosmicmikan: started the anime too
[15:22:08]  clouds617: I cant believe naruto ended
[15:22:24]  clouds617: why tie up your story and give it an ending when you can drag it out forever
[15:22:26]  clouds617: one piece
[15:22:35]  chef_zack: one piece will be around till im 70
[15:22:47]  twistedgm: The last anime I saw was toradora, and that was a couple of years back

[15:25:32]  twistedgm: They still haven't found it ?!?
[15:25:59]  clouds617: imo if your anime manga whatever goes past like 100 chapters youre just fucking around
[15:26:15]  clouds617: I loved parasite its one of my top manga/anime and I think it was like 80 chapters
[15:26:45]  clouds617: do you get stuff straight from the source since you can read japanese

[15:41:11]  clouds617: isn't there a whole other section for exclusive languages
[15:41:25]  clouds617: I think they meant need
[15:41:27]  clouds617: NEET
[15:41:39]  clouds617: you can't be a japanese weeb
[15:43:10]  clouds617: the stereotypical ones that live in an apartment by themselves with hundreds of anime figures and the place is trashed with anime posters and crap
[15:43:45]  chef_zack: i dont think you can generalize something like that
[15:45:33]  clouds617: these are the questions that don't get answered in American media so we can do is speculate ktrzetGZ
[15:45:49]  clouds617: all we can do*

[15:54:08]  deohang: Do you have any resolutions for this yeah
[15:54:32]  clouds617: the Japanese keyboard on Samsung is kinda nice
[15:54:45]  clouds617: I type su shi and it makes the characters for me
[15:54:49]  chef_zack: Sadge
[15:55:01]  clouds617: ありがと
[15:56:08]  clouds617: tou?
[15:56:21]  clouds617: 等?
[15:56:30]  clouds617: とう
[15:56:37]  clouds617: shit
[15:56:55]  clouds617: I dont even know how I did the kanji
[15:57:53]  clouds617: I have much to learn after the alphabet
[15:58:18]  chef_zack: yeah you got 2 more alphabets
[15:58:19]  chef_zack: PepeLaugh
[15:58:39]  clouds617: does kanji even count as an alphabet
[15:59:00]  clouds617: another language ktrzetClean
[15:59:31]  chef_zack: its fairly similar to spanish's alphabet
[15:59:37]  clouds617: I dont even know how to spell lots of these things too I just know how they sound from Japanese media
[16:00:09]  clouds617: がか
[16:00:16]  clouds617: ばか
[16:01:04]  clouds617: wait that first one was actually a word?
[16:01:11]  clouds617: I just typed them out cause they look similar
[16:01:14]  clouds617: I knew ka
[16:01:24]  clouds617: oh duh mangaka
[16:02:08]  clouds617: so mangaka directly translates to comic artist
[16:02:14]  clouds617: more or less
[16:02:47]  clouds617: ka means house?
[16:02:54]  clouds617: かかりこ
[16:03:45]  clouds617: I typed out kakariko like zelda
[16:03:49]  clouds617: kakariko village
[16:04:20]  clouds617: I recognized the first 3 but it didn't have the ko
[16:04:25]  clouds617: I need to look at it again
[16:05:02]  clouds617: I learned 5 kanji
[16:06:10]  clouds617: I dont really read anything Japanese or talk to Japanese people so no shot ill remember
[16:06:19]  clouds617: You're the closest thing I get to Japanese
[16:06:58]  clouds617: right this might as well be my review here
[16:07:41]  clouds617: カカリコ村
[16:08:20]  clouds617: the village is kanji?
[16:09:10]  clouds617: oh so the 4th is katakana no wonder I didnt recognize it
[16:10:07]  clouds617: is there like a baseline all japanese know these kanji, cause otherwise people would be having to google stuff all the time
[16:11:11]  clouds617: my friend whos in class said youre considered more intelligent if you know more kanji, I was unsure if there was stuff people just didnt know
[16:11:32]  clouds617: new kanji just dropped Pog
[16:12:01]  clouds617: cause there isnt a kanji for every single word right
[16:13:00]  clouds617: learning a language is so fun
[16:13:16]  clouds617: it would probably be much more worth my time to learn spanish LUL
[16:13:34]  clouds617: there might be like a whole 2 people that speak japanese in my state
[16:13:43]  chef_zack: should try duolingo clouds
[16:13:53]  clouds617: duolingo for japanese is kinda wack ngl
[16:14:30]  clouds617: ive used it for spanish tho
[16:14:40]  clouds617: I dont like how its kinda a game
[16:14:54]  clouds617: its got a monetization model
[16:15:06]  clouds617: id rather pay for a class
[16:15:36]  clouds617: you can do it ktrzetCheer
[16:15:42]  kaeos: ktrZetto
[16:16:02]  clouds617: I love using that emote passive aggressively
[16:17:21]  clouds617: why would you say that outloud PepeLaugh
[16:17:37]  clouds617: I made this :)
[16:18:30]  clouds617: should I finish learning hiragana before learning phrases or try to do them side by side
[16:20:03]  clouds617: you call the individual characters ramji?
[16:20:04]  clouds617: romaji
[16:20:12]  clouds617: big typo
[16:22:13]  rinta_rnt: ワンちゃん１８じ
[16:22:42]  clouds617: does your relation with someone influence how you talk to them a lot?
[16:24:06]  deohang: Did you just change the title of your stream
[16:24:39]  deohang: I got a notification with "hat girls in your area"
[16:24:45]  deohang: Hot**

[16:27:08]  happymilks: which cover did you get on the practice rom cart liamkWomp
[16:27:37]  clouds617: yeah it would be a lot easier to open it up and try to cut it
[16:27:40]  happymilks: OMEGALUL
[16:27:42]  clouds617: you dont need power tools
[16:27:57]  happymilks: did you get an expansion pak?
[16:28:22]  clouds617: do you want a vid that shows how to take apart an n64?
[16:28:38]  happymilks: you need that for it to work, just got one & haven't tried it yet though
[16:29:33]  happymilks: mine was $65 for a beat up used one but i bet it's like $15 in japan
[16:29:41]  clouds617: just look up odd tinkering n64 on youtube if need a reference
[16:29:46]  clouds617: he takes it apart completely
[16:30:07]  happymilks: hes so fast Pog
[16:30:08]  nightbot: What's up, local degenerate shillbot here to tell you that if you have Amazon Prime, you can link it with your Twitch account for a free sub!
[16:30:14]  chef_zack: the expansion pak is 60 bucks POGGERS
[16:30:29]  chef_zack: i have one in box Pog
[16:31:06]  happymilks: gonna irl stream it? COPIUM
[16:31:50]  happymilks: it will COPIUM
[16:32:27]  happymilks: Prayge
[16:32:39]  happymilks: NICE
[16:32:56]  chef_zack: Sadge
[16:33:04]  happymilks: WHAAT could've tried again
[16:34:20]  clouds617: im already forgetting hiragana COPIUM
[16:34:40]  clouds617: practicing once a week doesnt work who wouldve thought
[16:35:01]  happymilks: oohh hmmmm
[16:35:02]  cosmicmikan: i practice an hour a day
[16:35:11]  chef_zack: what else is there to teach you
[16:35:12]  happymilks: did you know that in lists
[16:35:26]  happymilks: the third comma is called the oxford comma
[16:35:32]  cosmicmikan: yeah because i meet my tutor once a week, and dont wanna make a fool of myself
[16:35:46]  clouds617: why only the third one
[16:35:54]  happymilks: so in "i bought apples, bananas, and oranges" the comma after "bananas" is the oxford comma
[16:36:12]  clouds617: the oxford comma is only the final comma in a list
[16:36:25]  happymilks: final comma ^
[16:36:27]  happymilks: my bad
[16:36:48]  clouds617: just cause
[16:36:50]  clouds617: probably
[16:37:05]  clouds617: unless it defines the concept of using commas for lists
[16:37:07]  happymilks: was used by editors at oxford university press, wasn't traditionally used
[16:37:21]  happymilks: but was adopted as standard because of how well it clarifies sentences
[16:37:27]  clouds617: makes sense
[16:37:33]  happymilks: you should :)
[16:38:09]  clouds617: if you have a list of objects its much cleaner to say I bought apples, bananas, oranges, and pineapples
[16:38:27]  clouds617: instead of I bought apples and bananas and oranges and pineapples
[16:38:35]  clouds617: youre typing a single , instead of and every time LUL
[16:39:10]  clouds617: you can keep typing and everytime if you want man we over here are chilling with our boy oxford
[16:39:34]  happymilks: the other two objects in the sentence look like they're paired even if they're not
[16:39:51]  clouds617: TRUE
[16:39:54]  kaeos: Haine goes to Cambridge
[16:40:02]  happymilks: for example "i invited my husband, a lawyer and a doctor"
[16:40:18]  happymilks: someone can misread that as your husband is a lawyer and a doctor
[16:40:24]  happymilks: when they're two seperate people you're inviting
[16:40:37]  clouds617: but in that instance youre defining a list with the comma right away
[16:40:41]  clouds617: the and doesnt make it a list anymore
[16:41:10]  clouds617: oh wait
[16:41:31]  clouds617: I can see why it matters now cause you can read that like 3 ways
[16:41:49]  clouds617: nah english is just fucked bro turn back
[16:42:04]  happymilks: then voice inflection matters
[16:42:37]  happymilks: but when it's written then it's an evident list in a formal sentence
[16:42:45]  clouds617: its so weird to me that the world has to learn english and here we are just given a choice of whatever is being taught at our schools
[16:43:01]  happymilks: WTF
[16:43:03]  happymilks: OMEGALUL
[16:43:12]  chef_zack: indubitably 3Head

[16:45:09]  happymilks: only if you stream earlier :)
[16:45:16]  clouds617: he unbanned a dude just cause he had twitch prime
[16:45:43]  happymilks: im about to reach 100k channel points without betting
