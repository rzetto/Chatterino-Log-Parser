[09:29:45]  kirosthegreat: ktrzetFrown
[09:29:46]  laurabraus: whats up
[09:30:23]  scottief: Pizza with hot sauce is the best thing ever
[09:31:11]  haine_sense1: I would tend to disagree, but that’s just cos I don’t like hot sauce in general
[09:31:23]  laurabraus: yeah im intolerant to spice
[09:31:31]  scottief: Get some crystal hot sauce and you’ll agree
[09:31:33]  scottief: It’s gas
[09:31:42]  scottief: Also I thought pizza with hot sauce was common in japan
[09:32:01]  haine_sense1: It’s not a general thing - quite a few do but I never got into it
[09:32:03]  laurabraus: in america its the stereotype that white people in general cant handle or dont like spicy
[09:32:12]  laurabraus: im white people
[09:32:24]  scottief: Couldn’t be me
[09:32:27]  laurabraus: but i did try hot sauce on eggs and it was not bad
[09:32:40]  scottief: I’ve recently become a convert
[09:32:46]  scottief: I’m putting hot sauce on everything
[09:33:00]  laurabraus: yeah
[09:33:04]  laurabraus: we're a diverse country
[09:33:21]  scottief: Takis are not spicy
[09:33:22]  kirosthegreat: White people eat plenty of spicy food ._.

[09:34:59]  scottief: That’s what they deserve for not eating spicy food
[09:35:04]  laurabraus: @Scottief takis ARE spicy....
[09:35:09]  scottief: Cap
[09:35:19]  kirosthegreat: It's the boot looking state in the south. It has New Orleans.

[09:37:08]  haine_sense1: Idk
[09:37:11]  laurabraus: ok confirmed dioritos are the top sold salty snack here
[09:37:13]  kirosthegreat: It's an excuse to party hard. You go around drinking and tossing beads, and if your beads catch the eye of someone, they might do something for it orooShrug
[09:37:15]  kirosthegreat: French
[09:37:17]  kaeos: fat tuesday

[09:40:31]  scottief: mad drinking culture
[09:40:48]  scottief: jan 6th the deep meaning is that its the 12th night of christmas
[09:40:52]  kirosthegreat: It's technically just a New Orleans things, but everyone in Louisiana started celebrating, and then it spread to other southern states. Now you can find some Mardi Gras festivals as far north as Ohio.
[09:41:03]  haine_sense1: Zetto’s Korean right?
[09:41:06]  scottief: true but they dont have nothing on the OG 😤
[09:41:31]  scottief: christmas has 12 days
[09:41:42]  scottief: the 12th day is when the three wise kings show up and give gifts to jesus
[09:41:43]  kirosthegreat: But in Louisiana, it's a government sanctioned holiday. No idea if other states officially observe it.
[09:42:05]  kaeos: yes
[09:42:12]  haine_sense1: On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree
[09:42:31]  kaeos: wait ur korean?

[09:42:44]  scottief: you basically get two spring breaks in LA cause mardi gras and spring break its sick
[09:42:57]  kirosthegreat: Close to the north yeah, and funny enough some people consider Ohio part of the south... I think those people need a geography lesson, but I can't deny its people are very southernish.
[09:43:02]  haine_sense1: On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me 2 turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
[09:43:07]  haine_sense1: Maybe

[09:46:17]  kirosthegreat: Like, I thiiink I've heard something like that before. Been in Louisiana all my life. A couple people didn't get that Asia wasn't a country and was confused by what Chinese, Japanese, and Korean meant. That happened while at a Chinese restaurant.

[11:56:40]  dvsblack: you can tell its just the game glitching
[11:56:55]  kaeos: i get 600 up and down which is good by US standards
[11:57:10]  dvsblack: idk the time clock looks normal
[11:57:41]  kaeos: i thought EU countries got like gigabit connections by default
[11:57:50]  dvsblack: 600 up and down isnt necessarily different from 30 up and down
[11:57:53]  dvsblack: in a lot of cases
[11:58:02]  dvsblack: what matters more is ping
[11:58:48]  kaeos: i only know germanys internet sucks because deohangs stream lags every 10 seconds
[11:59:53]  nightbot: peepoHug Hit the follow button if you enjoy the stream so you can come back for more! 配信が面白かったらフォローしてね！
