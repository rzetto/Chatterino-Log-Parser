[09:05:09]  iop4everdudes: i legit thought i got blanked. was about to find another Clint clone Kappa
[09:05:13]  cosmicmikan: LAURA HIIIII
[09:05:16]  laurabraus: ERINNN
[09:05:19]  yourcrazym8: I feel like I'm muted in real life cause nobody cares about anything I say so I can relate
[09:05:48]  cosmicmikan: ahh good
[09:05:53]  laurabraus: thats good
[09:07:37]  laurabraus: pretty good B)
[09:08:27]  laurabraus: "people care......well"
[09:09:35]  laurabraus: true
[09:11:56]  kaeos: hey zetto ive been busy having sex, finally caught u live, looking good bud
[09:11:56] kaeos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months!
[09:12:24]  laurabraus: are you havin sex rn
[09:12:29]  laurabraus: tell them i said hi
[09:12:31]  kaeos: always
[09:13:55]  kaeos: i just sleep less to make time
[09:14:11]  laurabraus: theres nothing i want to do so i have too much time
[09:14:18]  kaeos: "Give ktrZetto Feedback"
[09:14:28]  yourcrazym8: I always find it hilarious how people create super hero movies or anime where they portray the heros as being super caring etc. like in their wishful thinking because they know that real life sucks and actual humans don't give a damn about things. It's ironic because these "good", "heroic" characteristics of humans are all fiction. üòÇ It's sad and stupidly hilarious at the same time.
[09:14:30]  kaeos: i can only choose three from skill, dedication, humor, responsiveness, relatability
[09:15:12]  laurabraus: its good you wanna do stuff!!
[09:15:34]  kaeos: you're finally chasing your dreams of being a pro smash player?
[09:17:11]  robertzarmy: more like super sleepio 64
[09:17:50]  kaeos: picking up female specimens ?
[09:18:10]  robertzarmy: zetto is an avid andrew tate fan
[09:18:21]  kaeos: im a tatertard myself
[09:18:28]  laurabraus: yes
[09:18:46]  kaeos: simply don't finish school and don't get a job to avoid that pitfall
[09:19:00]  laurabraus: become a hermit
[09:19:11]  laurabraus: go off the grid
[09:19:36]  kaeos: ur quiet imo
[09:19:42]  kaeos: but i dont think the mic settings changed
[09:19:45]  kaeos: i think its the depression
[09:19:57]  robertzarmy: he changed sounds for omori yesterday
[09:20:05]  cosmicmikan: oh no lmao
[09:20:32]  laurabraus: dude i am in the SAME boat as you rn
[09:20:50]  kaeos: schools made me the most depressed in my life
[09:20:54]  kaeos: like suicidal
[09:20:54]  robertzarmy: you guys can all come to cybersecurity
[09:20:54]  laurabraus: yes
[09:20:57]  robertzarmy: its a growing field
[09:21:10]  yourcrazym8: People have the mindset "well, there are enough people being nice etc so I don't have to bother myself with restrictions in my life for a better environment and I am too lazy for a consistent friendship etc." Looking at the world now, I feel being ignorant about all the miseries and bad developments is what keeps people who are somewhat aware of their surroundings exhausted and depressed.
[09:21:33]  kaeos: just go to school part time
[09:21:43]  laurabraus: sometimes just being stable has to be enough i've decided
[09:22:17]  robertzarmy: how expensive is school
[09:22:30]  kaeos: do u wanna go to school to have friends your age again or just for a degree for a new job
[09:23:01]  kaeos: ive heard this song in my autoplay

[09:24:13]  iop4everdudes: you can hear it
[09:24:56]  iop4everdudes: egg is my favourite food, especially in the summer
[09:25:10]  kaeos: why do u need security guards for the internet ü§£ü§£ü§£
[09:25:11]  laurabraus: i want to go back to school and study counseling. i think. but its a process and i know its gonna be long and i keep procrastinating it
[09:25:26]  robertzarmy: u gotta stop procrastinating laura
[09:25:39]  laurabraus: procrastinating my whole life over here tbh

[09:30:13]  kaeos: why do you need to simulate depression
[09:30:15]  kaeos: you seem to have plenty
[09:30:21]  robertzarmy: someone ban this guy
[09:30:54]  kaeos: when are you playing multiversus with viewers
[09:31:02]  robertzarmy: that's what I'm saying
[09:31:07]  yourcrazym8: Me: also has enough friends‚Ä¶. Also Me: raises one finger to count my friends‚Ä¶. At least he's someone whom I can consider part of my family, he helped me out when I was in a financial hell and on the verge of doing very stupid things etc. Thing is, I don't feel lonely at all.
[09:31:26]  cosmicmikan: quality over quantity

[09:38:11]  yourcrazym8: I'm socially inept. Like I can talk and engage in conversations like "normal" humans but I'm always stressed by the thoughts of not living up to my own expectations of being a reliable, competent and eloquent person people will remember so I rather just not say anything at all except to the one friend whom I know quite well.
[09:38:29]  robertzarmy: you sound like that one guy that got banned
[09:38:32]  robertzarmy: are you his alt

[09:40:37]  robertzarmy: ok that's a little extreme
[09:41:28]  laurabraus: i definitely feel like a side character most of the time
