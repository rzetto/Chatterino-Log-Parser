[11:05:19]  robertzarmy: tons of places are blocking russia
[11:05:39]  laurabraus: but they block the website i think
[11:05:47]  chisasfam: the companies arent blocking then its the government bc alot of russians dont know whats doing on
[11:05:52]  laurabraus: but if he could do vpn then he could go imgur
[11:05:54]  robertzarmy: its possible twitch just wasnt blocked

[11:15:04]  snapsdude77: JK
[11:17:49]  chisasfam: hello snapsdude
[11:17:54]  chisasfam: I am not stinky
[11:19:04]  haine_sense1: yo
[11:19:23]  haine_sense1: it's going badly
[11:19:31]  haine_sense1: which is part of the reason I will not be here for long
[11:19:56]  haine_sense1: it's only really going badly because I am very behind on all work
[11:20:01]  andrewangus: こんにちは
[11:20:19]  haine_sense1: I feel completely fine in every way except feeling hopeless about all work
[11:20:57]  haine_sense1: I know lol
[11:21:25]  haine_sense1: woah, you're actually giving sensible advice
[11:21:44]  laurabraus: try to make a priority list too. like do the things that would literally fail you if you didnt first
[11:22:10]  haine_sense1: @laurabraus that assumes that I would follow said priority list and not just do nothing for 7 hours a day
[11:22:17]  laurabraus: yeah i feel you
[11:22:37]  laurabraus: i mean nobody can make you do it
[11:22:47]  haine_sense1: I had very much produced a plan of what to do yesterday: watch as many lectures as I could after dinner
[11:23:01]  laurabraus: sometimes studying with others helps keep you accountable
[11:23:01]  haine_sense1: what actually happened was I watched 0 lectures and did no other work
[11:23:14]  laurabraus: but thats overwhelming right
[11:23:28]  laurabraus: you probably finished dinner and were like god. that is so daunting. must run away
[11:23:34]  haine_sense1: the lectures I'm watching are fine
[11:24:30]  chisasfam: too lazy to do work yk
[11:24:53]  haine_sense1: the issue here being that I need to watch these lectures because the deadline is Monday (though actually delayed now probably since my supervision partner is having a hard time as well)
[11:25:04]  laurabraus: have like two-three things you want to accomplish instead of "all" and then sometimes youll get through those three and just be on a roll
[11:25:17]  laurabraus: and two-three is better than zero
[11:25:23]  laurabraus: getting started is the hardest part
[11:25:24]  haine_sense1: but still these lectures are fine to watch and are fun :)
[11:25:35]  haine_sense1: @laurabraus es it is
[11:25:36]  haine_sense1: yes
[11:25:42]  haine_sense1: I have now watched 2
[11:25:47]  haine_sense1: and will be going back to watching more
[11:26:13]  haine_sense1: (the deadline for work is Monday and the lectures haven't yet covered the content required for the work)
[11:26:26]  haine_sense1: some of them
[11:26:33]  haine_sense1: I enjoy some lectures
[11:26:45]  haine_sense1: the only problem is watching them online
[11:26:46]  laurabraus: id much rather read a textbook
[11:27:07]  haine_sense1: like, for geometry, the lectures are fun
[11:27:19]  haine_sense1: for complex analysis, the lectures are EXTREME PAIN
[11:27:31]  haine_sense1: fortunately now I will not be watching the lectures
[11:27:36]  haine_sense1: for that course
[11:27:53]  haine_sense1: for Groups rings and modules, the lectures are fun
[11:27:59]  laurabraus: i will say psychology lectures were mostly awesome
[11:27:59]  haine_sense1: for statistics, the lectures are fun
[11:28:09]  haine_sense1: @laurabraus this is reasonable
[11:28:58]  haine_sense1: but because I had complex analysis due recently, I was in extreme depresso mode and not doing any work
[11:29:35]  haine_sense1: so.... I'm now 4 (6 before the 2 I just watched) lectures behind on Geometry
[11:30:17]  haine_sense1: also, the thing about geometry and complex analysis is that they are fun courses but I kinda think I'll be really bad at them because they end up requiring the ability to integration
[11:30:20]  haine_sense1: which I have lost
[11:30:41]  haine_sense1: to do integration*
[11:31:08]  haine_sense1: wait you have a sub hour pb now?
[11:31:11]  haine_sense1: I had not noticed
[11:31:13]  haine_sense1: nice!
[11:31:52]  haine_sense1: oh other thing: I haven't been eating enough and as such have ended up having somewhat regular accidental 12 hour sleeps
[11:32:38]  haine_sense1: it's weird lol
[11:33:13]  haine_sense1: it means that I keep planning to do stuff at one point but then not waking up til 4 hours later than expected
[11:34:26]  haine_sense1: anyway, since that's been fucking with my sleep schedule I should get back to watching lectures lol
[11:34:38]  haine_sense1: hm... would I want to watch you while half asleep
[11:34:59]  chisasfam: gl !
[11:34:59]  haine_sense1: I mean would I want to watch you in general?
[11:35:05]  haine_sense1: hmmm
[11:35:45]  haine_sense1: heh
[11:36:01]  haine_sense1: but yea, cya and goodluck
[11:36:21]  haine_sense1: I want my small number of points that I have bet on you getting to tippy

[12:44:59]  cosmicmikan: @Haine_Sense1 you know what, you might be right

[12:45:28]  cosmicmikan: massive brain
[12:45:36]  laurabraus: clearly i dont register the noises from this game anymore since i watched your stream yesterday when your sound was broken and didnt notice at all
[12:45:38]  haine_sense1: lol
[12:46:24]  laurabraus: or i really have memorized it and just mentally matched the sound to what i was seeing
[12:46:34]  haine_sense1: I could imagine sound being helpful for rhythms in some places but that's all
[12:46:47]  laurabraus: LOL YEAH
[12:46:52]  cosmicmikan: lmao
[12:47:16]  haine_sense1: was that just you falling off stages a lot?

[13:02:23]  haine_sense1: that's not specifically for tomorrow
[13:02:25]  haine_sense1: but eh
[13:02:26]  haine_sense1: I'm tired
[13:02:33]  cosmicmikan: PogChamp
[13:02:44]  haine_sense1: oh cool
[13:02:50]  haine_sense1: yep
[13:02:59]  haine_sense1: 4am totally a healthy time to go to bed ;)
[13:03:08]  cosmicmikan: absolutely
[13:03:22]  haine_sense1: I woke up at 3pm
[13:03:27]  haine_sense1: so it's not that bad really
[13:04:00]  haine_sense1: it's mostly just tired since I watched 3 lectures just now which always tires me out a bit
[13:04:13]  haine_sense1: particularly when they're all on the same content
[13:04:23]  haine_sense1: which is hard
[13:04:31]  haine_sense1: as opposed to easy topics
[13:06:10]  haine_sense1: we've just gone onto geodesics and I'm like "cool I know what these are" while also being like "not that we know how to find any of them"
[13:07:03]  haine_sense1: geodesics are "locally shortest paths"
[13:07:22]  haine_sense1: that is, in flat space straight lines
[13:07:47]  haine_sense1: in curved space, they actually end up being the "straightest" lines
[13:09:19]  haine_sense1: on the surface of a sphere, they are arcs of great circles (the largest possible circles on the surface of a sphere)
[13:10:07]  haine_sense1: basically, the shortest paths on spheres are those paths
[13:11:00]  haine_sense1: ascii art pics?
[13:11:11]  cosmicmikan: valiant effort tho
[13:11:17]  haine_sense1: maybe not lol
[13:11:56] ブライトくん bright_f4: If you are justice, please do not lie. What is the price for your blind eye?
[13:12:47]  haine_sense1: but yea, I just ate some food which is why I'm staying a little bit, but really the only reason I'm awake is to watch lectures, so I should sleep soon since my eyes are too tired to watch more.
[13:13:16] ブライトくん bright_f4: @haine_sense1 You are el rata alada.
[13:13:31]  haine_sense1: what?
[13:13:36]  cosmicmikan: sorry, i don't speak french.
[13:13:52] ブライトくん bright_f4: @cosmicmikan It can be cruel, poetic, or blind. But when it’s denied, it’s violence you may find
[13:14:05] ブライトくん bright_f4: Google and you shall know the answers
[13:14:53]  haine_sense1: orrr.... I could leave chat and get ready to sleep
[13:14:59]  cosmicmikan: but im lazyyyyyyyyyyyy

[14:05:38]  robertzarmy: looks like he's a valorant player
[14:05:49]  cosmicmikan: fuck really?
[14:06:01]  robertzarmy: Hololive is far and away the biggest vtuber company
[14:06:05]  robertzarmy: with no competition

[14:08:28]  robertzarmy: it just sucks that hololive is the biggest company by a lot
[14:08:40]  robertzarmy: they probably take 80 or 90% of the vtubers income
[14:09:25]  robertzarmy: channel revenue
