[10:21:28]  kaeos: i only see you with your mask on so i thought it was like kakashi where its implied the mask never comes off
[10:23:26]  chisasfam: lurking baby girl
[10:23:43]  kaeos: he doesnt eat ever

[10:31:11]  kaeos: how long do you think its gonna take for a big streamer to get killed on camera
[10:31:18]  kaeos: like shot up in the club or something
[10:31:51]  kaeos: yeah but he didnt so it doesnt count
[10:32:01]  kaeos: i guess i meant in a more gruesome way
[10:32:08]  kaeos: like car crash, gun to head, etc
[10:33:01]  kaeos: + ratio
[10:33:24]  kaeos: he fell off
[10:33:27]  kaeos: (of the mountain)
[10:34:07]  kaeos: i have my money on jakenbake
[10:34:21]  kaeos: the king of irl getting shanked in shibuya (not clickbait)
[10:35:10]  kaeos: i think itd make sense for the king of irl to get killed
[10:35:18]  kaeos: hes just the most likely imo
[10:35:39]  kaeos: or trainwreck OD on stream
[10:35:56]  kaeos: you couldnt convince me he doesnt
[10:36:54]  kaeos: maybe a really depressed streamer will jump off a building streaming it
[10:37:32]  kaeos: i think trainwrecks can be really funny but he's such a fucked person it negates it
[10:37:46]  laurabraus: @kaeos don't say that
[10:38:14]  kaeos: i mean i only care if its a 10k andy
[10:38:56]  kaeos: well enough to be a really public shock and loss
[10:39:07]  kaeos: im sure theres been 1-5 viewer streamers that have done it but its never reported on
[10:39:27]  kaeos: ye
[10:40:28]  kaeos: maybe call for help and then people try to call a bluff and then they do it
[10:41:21]  kaeos: i mean that pretty much was reckful and etika right
[10:42:04]  kaeos: sephiroth is top 5 change my mind
[10:42:57]  kaeos: did you see ludwigs balls leak
[10:43:21]  kaeos: no he pulled out his balls on a podcast for patreon
[10:43:36]  kaeos: theyre pretty big, clean shaven
[10:44:10]  kaeos: why not
[10:44:18]  kaeos: do it no balls
[10:47:48]  kaeos: COPIUM

[10:55:44]  kaeos: no i was just watching yoshidora stand next to acola after they played and hes shorter
