[06:57:27]  haine_sense1: early morning zetto stream = late night zetto stream
[06:57:42]  babsmcnh: I mean not playing any video games for an entire month would feel long for me
[06:57:50]  kirosthegreat: orooPat
[06:58:30]  robertzarmy: you gotta be more famous before you can go rogue.
[06:58:31]  babsmcnh: Are you still a god at MK PauseChamp
[06:58:43]  babsmcnh: Rob has a point
[06:58:48]  kirosthegreat: Well it's good to see you, even if life's been a mixed bag lately usausaWiggle
[06:59:03]  haine_sense1: just before stream I was just talking with a friend about how I wanted to make a 3D renderer and apply it to rendering 4D space
[06:59:26]  deohang: It’s ya boy jack, stole Jenny’s phone, hope you’re ok lad x
[06:59:26] DeoHang subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak!

[06:59:44]  babsmcnh: Good luck :)
[06:59:44]  robertzarmy: its only late for eu frogs
[06:59:46]  robertzarmy: and they don't matter
[07:00:09]  babsmcnh: Ey that’s true rob once I leave the EU
[07:00:15]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice. But if you want to help support the channel, and more importantly, help your boy get paid, feel free to click the link. Please give me your money. https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip https://www.twitch.tv/products/ktrZetto
[07:00:20]  babsmcnh: But for now EU frogs are the most important
[07:00:21]  chachatheboy: OMG HIIII CUTIE
[07:00:31]  natoleoo: KTR !!!!!!!
[07:00:31]  robertzarmy: its true especially because youre there babs

[07:01:17]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh ikr
[07:01:31]  babsmcnh: @robertzarmy if you’re trying to make me mad there’s no chance peepoHug I haven’t talked to you in ages I hope you’re vibing

[07:02:23]  haine_sense1: I'll be here, you wouldn't believe how much I've missed you <3
[07:02:41]  babsmcnh: Lol even if it’ll be gone, at least they were here FeelsStrongMan Clap
[07:02:43]  robertzarmy: babsmcnh its summer and I just play apex all day
[07:02:54]  babsmcnh: Are you good at apex?
[07:03:16]  robertzarmy: I think I'm decent
[07:03:17]  kirosthegreat: Rendering 4D has to be weird without a 3D medium... We can project 3D on a 2D screen like this game, but imagine trying to project 3D on a 1D surface. That's why I think it's useless to try to show 4D on any screen orooShrug
[07:04:04]  babsmcnh: Interesting point of view kiros
[07:04:17]  babsmcnh: Yeah I agree
[07:04:25]  babsmcnh: I think Pepega
[07:04:44]  robertzarmy: it is summer because my school year is over
[07:04:56]  babsmcnh: Also zetto still has good music taste HYPERS
[07:05:20]  haine_sense1: @KirosTheGreat a common method is just to render a 3D cross-section of the 4D world
[07:05:25]  babsmcnh: Does that mean you’ll get WR in a week PauseChamp
[07:05:46]  robertzarmy: I normally don't get out until mid june
[07:05:49]  robertzarmy: but college is just sick
[07:06:06]  haine_sense1: @KirosTheGreat and allow for rotating/shifting the cross section
[07:06:15]  babsmcnh: In Canada I think schools finish by may 1st
[07:06:33]  babsmcnh: And then for the UK it’s like June depending on the place

[07:08:23]  babsmcnh: I never talk in the server cuz then I’d just be rambling to myself

[07:13:32]  babsmcnh: Rob you’re nice most of the time - your petty attempts at insults can’t get to me :)
[07:13:45]  babsmcnh: Zetto becomes a full time streamer Pog
[07:14:07]  haine_sense1: how much money do you need?

[07:16:09]  robertzarmy: we already got haine
[07:16:11]  babsmcnh: Becoming famous sounds fucking horrible
[07:16:22]  kirosthegreat: If Zetto gets a thousand viewers or more, he'll never see my sexual advances yuniiSad
[07:17:01]  haine_sense1: there tends to be less weird people active in massive streams just because there are also people who aren't to keep them in check
[07:17:11]  babsmcnh: I think I’d rather not retire than be famous
[07:17:40]  babsmcnh: People get into my mental way too easy, being famous would be horrible for me
[07:17:51]  babsmcnh: Blood clots because I wouldn’t move around much
[07:18:03]  303devilfish: go clint go HYPERS
[07:18:06]  babsmcnh: Ohhhh yeah that does suck

[07:18:33]  robertzarmy: If I was retired I would do the exact same thing I'm doing now
[07:18:43]  babsmcnh: The other half is going to be horrible climate conditions HYPERS
[07:18:50]  303devilfish: you left for a month so could have fooled me

[07:21:35]  babsmcnh: You can cry after reading it
[07:21:51]  robertzarmy: Haine_Sense1 I said joe biden not global warming. did you read my message.
[07:21:57]  huckleberry262: smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol nah fam you finna EAT smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol smc5Emptyemotelol today

[07:22:23]  haine_sense1: no, he's using empty emotes
[07:22:23]  babsmcnh: I talked to other eng people and I think our best hope is getting another Einstein in the energy sector for green energy
[07:22:41]  robertzarmy: but will we die in our lifetime
[07:22:50]  haine_sense1: I would guess it's transparent
[07:22:57]  babsmcnh: So for the report they do chances using simulations
[07:23:07]  huckleberry262: smc5Emptyemotelol
[07:23:19]  babsmcnh: And for like 90% of the simulations of negative impacts it’s like “extremely likely”
[07:23:21]  haine_sense1: lol, nice highlight
[07:23:54]  babsmcnh: Like earlier deaths, water crisis, food shortage, improper soil, more deviating natural disasters etc.
[07:23:58]  babsmcnh: This is by 2100
[07:24:02]  303devilfish: AYAYA Clap
[07:24:24]  babsmcnh: So we’ll probably see the worst environment in human history by the end of our lives
[07:24:29]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh OH SHIT I WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A LIFE BEYOND 50 :(
[07:24:42]  babsmcnh: It’s okay though we will try to mitigate it HYPERS
[07:24:58]  babsmcnh: *eng = engineering
[07:25:06]  robertzarmy: you're being very positive babs
[07:25:09]  303devilfish: i'm in geography and trying to explain global warming to people who just say it's fake is really depressing Sadge
[07:25:09]  robertzarmy: it's good to hear!
[07:25:20]  kirosthegreat: I'm a natural disaster Sadge
[07:25:33]  babsmcnh: lol I’m sure it’ll be okay - it’s not good to think that everything will be over at once
[07:25:46]  robertzarmy: bermuda is fucked dude.
[07:25:55]  babsmcnh: PepeHands
[07:26:05]  haine_sense1: I've heard Cambridge will not last very long :)
[07:26:05]  babsmcnh: DONT MENTION MY HOME :(
[07:26:35]  babsmcnh: This will happen over years but i think it’s pretty annoying that politicians and economics are literally screwing over the entire lifespan of humanity
[07:26:52]  robertzarmy: all I need is one apex game with amatsuka uto
[07:27:01]  robertzarmy: and then whatever can happen i dont care
[07:27:12]  babsmcnh: Like at this point globalization of political systems is the only clear way we could stop it easily, but that would never happen
[07:27:40]  haine_sense1: Cambridge is not by the ocean but it is low
[07:27:59]  babsmcnh: Oh yeah cuz of the sinking lands and stuff think about the political and immigration problems because of it
[07:28:09]  303devilfish: But the stupid fucks vote in the stupid fucks Sadge
[07:28:12]  babsmcnh: ITS GONNA BE OKAY THOUGH :3
[07:28:25]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh it's not tho
[07:28:32]  babsmcnh: The thing is that the terms are only 4 years usually
[07:28:39]  robertzarmy: KILL THEM
[07:28:48]  303devilfish: some dipshit politician dropped a snowball onto the senate floor in the middle of winter and was like LOOK ITS ALL FAKE LMAO,
[07:29:00]  babsmcnh: The stupid fucks will get back in and then they’ll go back to the same old shit
[07:29:08]  babsmcnh: DEVIL NOOOO
[07:29:28]  babsmcnh: Well the only thing we have left is hope haine Prayge
[07:29:37]  haine_sense1: we don't have hope tho
[07:30:00]  babsmcnh: I’d rather stay hopeful on the future than be depressed about  it - I’d wanna find a solution
[07:30:05]  babsmcnh: I HAVE HOPE :)
[07:30:13]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh fair enough I guess
[07:30:35]  haine_sense1: OH YEA!!! WE NEED A WORLD WAR WITH ONE NATION WINNING :)
[07:30:35]  robertzarmy: thats just putin
[07:31:10]  babsmcnh: Yeah zetto there are so many cons to globalization but some countries emit so much pollutants that other countries that don’t emit basically have no effect
[07:31:29]  babsmcnh: So yeah I think the Einstein option is our best bet
[07:31:38]  babsmcnh: But we gotta keep moving forward!!!
[07:31:49]  babsmcnh: I believe in you guys ;)
[07:32:13]  babsmcnh: In whatever jobs you do I hope you try ur all and I’ll try my best too HYPERS
[07:32:42]  kirosthegreat: NODDERS
[07:33:23] robertzarmy redeemed Sound Alert: say hello! 100
[07:33:35]  babsmcnh: Tbh I think the fact that humans are humans will be our downfall if that makes sense
[07:33:53]  soundalerts: rinta_rnt played door knock for 10 Bits
[07:34:01]  babsmcnh: We focus on enjoyment rather than progress if that makes sense
[07:34:14] 303devilfish redeemed Dab 200
[07:34:22]  babsmcnh: I like that about us, I’d hate for everyone to be robots n shit
[07:34:37]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh well what's there to live for if not enjoyment?
[07:34:42]  babsmcnh: Like we have jobs for fashion, entertainment etc.

[07:35:13]  robertzarmy: hot wife .
[07:35:24]  kirosthegreat: Mhm
[07:35:29]  babsmcnh: But I’m just saying in an ideal scenario if we did 100% progress we would’ve fixed this problem
[07:35:30]  haine_sense1: what's considered progress?
[07:35:54]  303devilfish: more GDP
[07:35:57]  babsmcnh: Yeah that’s kinda true - they focused on progress rather than consequences
[07:36:19]  babsmcnh: But that’s why I’m doing sustainable engineering :) so in the future i don’t fuck over someone
[07:36:46]  haine_sense1: Hey Zetto, are you enjoying these super positive stream vibes?

[07:37:54]  babsmcnh: That’s true kiros!
[07:37:56]  haine_sense1: @robertzarmy so you won't be the last person to die?
[07:37:58]  kirosthegreat: Good news is that time will erase all of humanity's mistakes

[07:42:08]  kirosthegreat: The States have cost of living increases built into social security, so it's not much of a concern for typical people. Anyone who depends on a certain amount of wealth will have it hard though. Then you absolutely need to save up about half of your earnings.
[07:42:08]  babsmcnh: Pog
[07:42:15]  haine_sense1: nico nico streams still exist?
[07:42:24]  babsmcnh: Sukkuno :)

[07:52:10]  babsmcnh: Is that Luna?
[07:52:28]  babsmcnh: LUL
[07:53:25]  babsmcnh: This is why i ain’t touching crypto
[07:53:40]  babsmcnh: I would only invest in shit that literally makes sense in my mind
[07:53:44]  bauldi: crypto is incredibly lucrative
[07:53:53]  bauldi: if you play the game right
[07:54:09]  babsmcnh: Yeah Bitcoin isn’t doing well
[07:54:36]  babsmcnh: Bro I’m surprised you aren’t secretly a trader for ur job
[07:54:37]  bauldi: bitcoins pretty unsustainable
[07:54:44]  bauldi: its too big for itself

[07:59:35]  babsmcnh: Bro I saw an infographic that clothes are worn 4 times on average before being thrown out
[07:59:48]  bauldi: crypto is imploding and stonks go burned
[08:00:01]  babsmcnh: Meanwhile I’m wearing the same pants every other day and I’ve had shirts for 10 years
[08:00:07]  bauldi: good time to buy a few stonks if you have spare dollubs though
[08:00:12]  bauldi: could turn a nice profit

[08:01:30]  fisherangus: LUL
[08:01:40]  bauldi: hes into swinging and trading? kinky boi

[08:04:26]  bauldi: Prayge bauldiAscend
[08:04:31]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh the people who like crypto are also the people who don't use clothes for long?
[08:04:32]  babsmcnh: NOTED
[08:04:42]  laurabraus: @babsmcnh i’m at work but i’m good :)
[08:04:44]  bauldi: bauldiAscend let there be ktrzetto is live

[08:05:03]  haine_sense1: lol
[08:05:05]  haine_sense1: no
[08:05:13]  haine_sense1: I hate talking about crypto
[08:05:18]  babsmcnh: I think the people who don’t use clothes much are like fashionistas
[08:05:21]  bauldi: crypto is an incredible way to gamble but not say youre gambling
[08:05:23]  bauldi: :)
[08:05:24]  haine_sense1: I literally took my earphones out
[08:05:42]  haine_sense1: @Bauldi sounds accurate
[08:05:44]  bauldi: because when I say I invest in bitcoin eth and crypto noone calls me stupid
[08:05:53]  babsmcnh: I think STEM people consume less clothes imo just cuz they know the amount of energy it takes in general
[08:05:58]  bauldi: but cant say that about blackjack
[08:06:09]  babsmcnh: But there’s so many other jobs
[08:06:16]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh I consume less clothes because I'm awkward wearing different clothes
[08:06:24]  babsmcnh: Sameeee
[08:06:31]  laurabraus: also babs i hope UR doing good
[08:06:33]  babsmcnh: But like let’s say if you’re in business
[08:06:41]  303devilfish: i have a shirt that's literally dissolving, i've worn it for like 14 years
[08:06:47]  babsmcnh: For my sister she buys new clothes all the time
[08:06:59]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh no, I'd rather die :)
[08:07:04]  babsmcnh: Thank you Laura HYPERS I’m gonna start a group therapy session soon
[08:07:15]  laurabraus: NICE
[08:07:25]  babsmcnh: I think people just like looking individual, which is fine
[08:07:50]  babsmcnh: But it has rly bad impacts since they throw it away and waste energy upcycling it
[08:07:52] ブライトくん bright_f4: Is he pooping?
[08:08:01]  babsmcnh: Yeah it’s a fat one apparently
[08:08:03]  303devilfish: ya

[08:08:44]  kirosthegreat: Woddling is based usausaNodders
[08:08:54]  babsmcnh: But some people think it’s embarrassing to wear the same shirt twice
[08:08:56]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh I look individual wearing the same hoodie and comfy trousers as always when everyone else in Cambridge is either in sports specific clothing or formal attire
[08:09:10]  babsmcnh: Lol true
[08:09:28] ブライトくん bright_f4: Pewdiepie moved to japan with his wife two days ago
[08:09:30]  babsmcnh: He’s in the UK rn I believe
[08:09:34] ブライトくん bright_f4: They came on a private jet apparently
[08:09:35]  babsmcnh: oh damnnn

[09:13:19]  laurabraus: but if you DID say anything directed at me i wanted you to know
[09:13:36]  laurabraus: stromboli is like bread stuffed with cheese and meat
[09:14:17]  laurabraus: it's cooked in the bread though differently. it's more like a pizza rolled in on itself
[09:14:26]  laurabraus: like pizza buritto. but flatter
[09:14:59]  laurabraus: THEYRE NOT
[09:15:00]  laurabraus: BUT THEY SHOULD BE
[09:15:34]  laurabraus: roll up a pizza
[09:15:49]  laurabraus: a pizza roll not being an entire slice of pizza rolled up is kind of a scam right
[09:15:56]  laurabraus: pizza rolls are more like pizza BALLS
[09:16:12]  laurabraus: i dont know why i had to type balls in caps but thats just who i am

[09:20:28]  thxrd: Like in an oven
[09:20:41]  parkgimbap: LuL you pretty much take the pizza dough and fold it
[09:21:00]  frostneptune: oven baked but sometimes they're fried
[09:21:20]  laurabraus: it turns out the pizza roll brand is actually called tostino's. but yeah
[09:21:31]  laurabraus: i think tostitos are chips

[09:21:46]  frostneptune: before
[09:21:55]  thxrd: Before
[09:22:17]  laurabraus: calzone is like a gigantic half-circle shaped pizza roll

[09:23:27]  laurabraus: any bread with cheese. amazing
[09:24:31]  laurabraus: i sent a bunch of pics to you whenever you look at them you'll understand
[09:24:32]  parkgimbap: shape wise just think of it as a giant dumpling
[09:24:42]  parkgimbap: with the folds and everything
[09:24:50]  laurabraus: they are all basically the same thing
[09:25:17]  laurabraus: LMAO
