[09:51:33]  deohang: ktrzetD
[09:52:03]  robertzarmy: but it's good
[09:52:19]  robertzarmy: some things are good enough that you're just dumb for not liking them
[09:52:25]  robertzarmy: like berserk
[09:53:00]  robertzarmy: yes
[09:53:05]  andrewangus: berk is a wee bit cringe
[09:53:11]  haine_sense1: What genre would you describe berserk as?
[09:53:20]  andrewangus: male fantasy
[09:53:23]  chef_zack: a tragedy
[09:53:44]  robertzarmy: berserk is the greatest manga of all time
[09:53:49]  haine_sense1: Woop woop lots of deaths
[09:54:01]  robertzarmy: no bias
[09:54:31]  haine_sense1: There is bias tho
[09:54:36]  robertzarmy: proof?
[09:55:01]  haine_sense1: Bias exists in everyone
[09:55:05]  robertzarmy: Not me
[09:55:05]  cosmicmikan: HI
[09:55:29]  robertzarmy: berserk art IS objectively good
[09:55:44]  andrewangus: the plot is incredible but having almost every female char getting r***** at some point makes it a lot worse :)
[09:55:59]  cosmicmikan: yeah its a tad...awkward
[09:56:05]  cosmicmikan: IM NOT OKAY KTR
[09:56:13]  cosmicmikan: i tried sleeping but i can
[09:56:16]  cosmicmikan: cant
[09:56:20]  robertzarmy: art can be objectively good
[09:56:50]  cosmicmikan: dude i have 315 fates saved for ayato
[09:56:54]  cosmicmikan: IM DOWN BAD
[09:57:36]  cosmicmikan: the way you pull for characters
[09:57:36]  cosmicmikan: yeah
[09:57:44]  haine_sense1: Well… for example, my stickman porn art is very good
[09:57:48]  haine_sense1: Objectively
[09:58:00]  cosmicmikan: nooo
[09:58:08]  cosmicmikan: hard pity is at 90
[09:58:09]  cosmicmikan: i want cons
[09:59:52]  nightbot: peepoHug Hit the follow button if you enjoy the stream so you can come back for more! 配信が面白かったらフォローしてね！
[10:00:07]  haine_sense1: well, I’d say that objective goodness of art relies upon its audience - if most of its intended audience thinks it is good, then it is objectively good
[10:01:24]  haine_sense1: Which is why my stickman porn art is objectively good because everyone I have sent it to (all 2 people) have said it was good
[10:01:36]  haine_sense1: (Or implied so)
[10:02:59]  cosmicmikan: i have no points lmao
[10:03:39]  laurabraus: whats up
[10:03:42]  laurabraus: HI MIKAN
[10:03:43]  cosmicmikan: thats a thing?
[10:03:43]  haine_sense1: Well that means you can hand out the points later if he gets a run
[10:03:48]  cosmicmikan: HI LAURAAAAAAA
[10:04:03]  cosmicmikan: idk what that is
[10:04:27]  cosmicmikan: ooooooooh
[10:04:28]  chef_zack: zetto you cant help these people
[10:04:40]  chef_zack: they've been on for a year they should know better smh
[10:04:53]  cosmicmikan: ive only used twitch for ktr shut up
[10:04:55]  haine_sense1: People, predict
[10:05:21]  chef_zack: yeah but at some point you gotta wonder why someone would say OMEGALUL
[10:05:32]  cosmicmikan: i just though yall were weird
[10:07:51]  cosmicmikan: its raining here
[10:07:57]  usausachu: Hi
[10:08:15]  cosmicmikan: a bit yea
[10:09:58]  cosmicmikan: that sounds sooooooooooooo interesting
[10:10:52]  cosmicmikan: hehe im just kidding
[10:11:28]  chef_zack: Pog
[10:13:08]  kaeos: I left yesterday bc u were rambling about money and stuff but ur still talking about it
[10:13:09]  cosmicmikan: thats cool tho
[10:13:45]  kaeos: take ur mask off
[10:13:46]  cosmicmikan: like a different game?
[10:13:50]  haine_sense1: @kaeos would you prefer talking about bl again?
[10:13:53]  kaeos: no
[10:13:58]  cosmicmikan: awe
[10:14:01]  haine_sense1: ;)
[10:14:17]  haine_sense1: Marbles
[10:14:24]  kaeos: watch anime on stream
[10:14:28]  kaeos: and live dub it
[10:14:51]  laurabraus: cooking stream
[10:15:08]  kaeos: that's transformative content it won't get you banned
[10:15:49]  chef_zack: in the ban report, "sykkuno copycat"
[10:15:50]  kaeos: didn't a twitch staff gift you like 80 subs
[10:15:55]  kaeos: get him to unban you
[10:16:55]  haine_sense1: Because you’re important
[10:16:59]  chef_zack: because he likes usa, which means usa is important to you which means it comes full circle EZ
[10:17:25]  laurabraus: ur not disposable >:(
[10:17:34]  kaeos: yes you are
[10:17:39]  laurabraus: if you got perma banned i would shed a tear
[10:17:47]  laurabraus: but just one
[10:18:13]  haine_sense1: Oh, this reminds me of all the times TheAnimeMan talked about Japan having a collectivist culture
[10:18:35]  kaeos: you sound spiteful
[10:19:12]  kaeos: nepotism
[10:19:40]  haine_sense1: Zetto networking
[10:19:50]  cosmicmikan: i would be sad
[10:20:25]  laurabraus: it means that it's more group-focused instead of focusing on the individual
[10:20:26]  chef_zack: what is a collectivist culture
[10:20:29]  kaeos: if you got banned on twitch, you should stream on discord and get everyone into one channel to use as a chat
[10:22:10]  laurabraus: yessss thats happening in america too. young people are catching onto that stuff
[10:22:31]  kaeos: I thought you didnt do it for the money
[10:22:42]  kaeos: I would not watch btw
[10:23:24]  haine_sense1: People don’t stay forever :0
[10:23:29]  kaeos: you are talking to yourself
[10:23:37]  kaeos: you don't notice because you're off your meds
[10:24:11]  chef_zack: jesus
[10:24:18]  haine_sense1: I’ll just go cry that I won’t know you forever :(
[10:24:34]  kaeos: that would be so funny
[10:24:45]  kaeos: u could get a whole page on the newspaper if u exploded
[10:26:37]  haine_sense1: Why care what people think after you die?
[10:26:54]  haine_sense1: You’d be dead, why would it matter?
[10:27:43]  kaeos: I can't wait for the whole chat to be vip or mod
[10:28:07]  kaeos: no
[10:28:09]  haine_sense1: Give me vip for free pls :)
[10:28:45]  kaeos: you need to collab with more vtubers to grow
[10:29:05]  haine_sense1: Give me mod for free then
[10:29:31]  haine_sense1: Whenever you do collabs I don’t watch lol
[10:29:34]  chef_zack: zetto colabs to be nice LULW
[10:29:52]  kaeos: I don't have discord friends either
[10:30:03]  kaeos: I try to use discord as little as possible
[10:30:26]  chef_zack: LUL
[10:30:33]  kaeos: I don't watch collabs because you're an interactive streamer but when you do collabs you straight up ignore chat
[10:30:38]  chef_zack: i was the one viewer watching you play crab game
[10:30:38]  laurabraus: ^^^^
[10:30:59]  kaeos: also the streamers you collab with are uwutubers and when their chat culture ever invades, it makes me not want to chat
[10:31:00]  haine_sense1: You say you don’t have discord friends, but you have me :)
[10:31:08]  laurabraus: i dont like listening to other people's voices on a call during a stream
[10:33:01]  kaeos: speaking of collabs I saw joshinjapan twerking yesterday
[10:33:15]  haine_sense1: Just put an uwu related meme in the discord
[10:33:36]  laurabraus: exactly
[10:34:01]  kaeos: well your collabs make you less funny
[10:34:04]  kaeos: imo
[10:34:17]  kaeos: since you're less comfortable to be a degen
[10:34:21]  laurabraus: @kaeos its cause hes holding back
[10:34:26]  laurabraus: yeah
[10:36:09]  haine_sense1: Just don’t hold back and be an extrovert Kappa
[10:36:32]  kaeos: I never expect a pb
[10:36:34]  kaeos: ever
[10:36:43]  haine_sense1: You’ll get a pb today
[10:38:24]  kaeos: tea and shuton are going to battle of bc you should go too
[10:38:55]  kaeos: u could be a translator
[10:39:20]  haine_sense1: It surprises me how much you’re comfortable talking out loud about weird things
[10:39:51]  kaeos: it's because he has a really good therapist
[10:40:23]  haine_sense1: Oh, say way worse shit now
[10:40:30]  kaeos: no
[10:40:33]  kaeos: you have a job
[10:40:53]  kaeos: yes
[10:41:17]  kaeos: when I think of degenerate, I think of rob
[10:42:04]  kaeos: school is just a mandatory waste of time so it's not the same imo
[10:42:11]  haine_sense1: When I think of degenerate, I think of things which don’t have nice invertible properties
[10:42:50]  chef_zack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_vgseuw_o8
[10:42:51]  chef_zack: oh no
[10:43:05]  haine_sense1: You don’t learn anything?
[10:43:15]  kaeos: I think I would have liked school if I grew up in Japan so I could be an anime protagonist
[10:43:18]  chef_zack: zelda delayed
[10:43:39]  haine_sense1: Yes, degenerate appears in maths to describe cases where normal methods break down
[10:43:46]  kaeos: I'm kinda happy it was delayed since now it won't overlap the release of the new Pokemon
[10:44:49]  nightbot: peepoHug Hit the follow button if you enjoy the stream so you can come back for more! 配信が面白かったらフォローしてね！
[10:45:14]  kaeos: ye
[10:45:14]  laurabraus: YEAH
[10:45:48]  kaeos: why would you buy Kirby and spend 60 bucks on 5 hours of playtime
[10:46:03]  haine_sense1: I was vaguely happy about the new Kirby, but then I played it and realised it didn’t suit my play style at all
[10:46:08]  chef_zack: kirby is 15 hours
[10:46:38]  chef_zack: metroid was around 12 but that game was awesome
[10:46:47]  kaeos: xqc is playing Mario kart you should snipe him
[10:46:56]  kaeos: but put ttv in ur username first
[10:48:09]  kaeos: are you gonna go to the streamer awards next year
[10:48:48]  kaeos: I nominated you for best just chatting
[10:49:35]  kaeos: react harder
[10:49:52]  haine_sense1: You’re basically already just talking about shit
[10:49:56]  chef_zack: idk how people do it
[10:50:15]  haine_sense1: Body pillow?
[10:50:19]  haine_sense1: Must see
[10:50:27]  kaeos: watch random YouTube videos
[10:50:40]  kaeos: take suggestions from chat so we can see how unfunny your community is
[10:51:59]  kaeos: just chatting = just reacting
[10:52:32]  haine_sense1: If he does that, I’ll have to go find some bl YouTube videos
[10:52:45]  haine_sense1: Actually…
[10:52:52]  kaeos: JP AIM LULW
[10:53:03]  haine_sense1: I’d have to go find the bl cafe video I saw
[10:53:44]  haine_sense1: But…
[10:53:58]  haine_sense1: It was a sub 30 fire sea
[10:54:17]  kaeos: wait that means I won points
[10:54:30]  haine_sense1: Yup
[10:54:36]  haine_sense1: You win so many points
[10:54:42]  kaeos: lol I took usas points
[10:55:23]  haine_sense1: Good, usas such a bad country
[10:56:35]  kaeos: why are they frying pans
[10:57:53]  kaeos: I feel like cum jars or something would be more on brand for you
[10:59:07]  haine_sense1: What are cum jars? Do people have them?
[10:59:44]  haine_sense1: Why lol?
[11:00:13]  maxifyer: Because some people are into that. Some have their girlfriend drink it or whatever
[11:00:31]  kaeos: can the mods give me my 2 points for believing
[11:00:56]  cosmicmikan: how
[11:00:57]  cosmicmikan: and im in game
[11:01:01]  maxifyer: That's why they freeze the cum
[11:01:10]  haine_sense1: you can’t do that since you’re in the game
[11:01:22]  kaeos: ur mods would do it if you paid them
[11:01:29]  kaeos: they should unionize
[11:02:31]  haine_sense1: Can you do that after making me a mod?
[11:02:32]  maxifyer: There was a Japanese guy who went into a brother with a cum jar and wanted the escort to drink it. He got permanently banned from the brothel LUL
[11:02:46]  kaeos: he went INTO a BROTHER?
[11:02:51]  kaeos: with a CUM JAR?
[11:03:01]  maxifyer: *brothel
[11:03:10]  kaeos: oh brothel I should have finished reading the message
[11:03:16]  maxifyer: LUL
[11:05:33]  maxifyer: Did you know there are submissive men who likes when their mistress makes them eat their won cum? LUL
[11:05:40]  maxifyer: *own
[11:05:42]  haine_sense1: Yes
[11:05:46]  haine_sense1: I definitely knew that
[11:05:49]  cosmicmikan: WutFace
[11:06:07]  kaeos: thanks for sharing 👍
[11:06:40]  maxifyer: Would you ever visit a dominatrix if you got the chance?
[11:07:16]  kaeos: how would you ever find out you have that kink
[11:07:23]  superdinomike: gross!
[11:08:39]  maxifyer: Do you know what Forced Bi is?
[11:08:52]  cosmicmikan: do you know how to talk about anything else?
[11:08:58]  haine_sense1: Lol
[11:09:01]  cosmicmikan: or are you incapable
[11:09:09]  haine_sense1: For once this isn’t me
[11:09:14]  cosmicmikan: HAHA
[11:09:24]  maxifyer: @cosmicmikan Where you talking to me?
[11:09:28]  cosmicmikan: yes
[11:09:49]  kaeos: wtf this is a safe space let them talk
[11:09:53]  maxifyer: I'm sorry! But we were talking about that stuff now anyway I thought
[11:10:44]  haine_sense1: Ok, I need to sleep again… hopefully more successfully than last night
[11:10:56]  cosmicmikan: gn
[11:10:56]  nightbot: https://clips.twitch.tv/GeniusCovertSalmonItsBoshyTime-NECqGzkggZv8lT-v
[11:11:13]  kaeos: I take full responsibility for bringing up cum jars
[11:11:20]  kaeos: I take pride in it, even
[11:11:26]  maxifyer: LUL
[11:11:57]  laurabraus: if i hear someone say cum jar one more time.
[11:12:09]  kaeos: the only person saying it is zetto
[11:12:31]  kaeos: no
[11:12:41]  maxifyer: Anyway, forced bi is when a domant mistress forces her slave boy to have sex with a man LUL
[11:12:57]  haine_sense1: How predictable given its name
[11:13:01]  kaeos: wow! what an interesting factoid :)
[11:13:35]  kaeos: why are you so sure of that
[11:13:35]  maxifyer: LUL
[11:14:09]  maxifyer: LUL
[11:14:15]  kaeos: broth L
[11:14:35]  haine_sense1: Oh fuck, I just remembered a nightmare I had about being fucked by an old man
[11:14:51]  maxifyer: LMAO
[11:15:01]  cosmicmikan: chat sure is...interesting today
[11:15:06]  chef_zack: haine bringing up SEX again BatChest
[11:15:20]  kaeos: BatChest
[11:15:48]  maxifyer: Zetto, have you ever been to a brothel?
[11:16:09]  kaeos: tbh I think I'm pretty normal in this chat
[11:16:16]  haine_sense1: I’m sorry, remembering such an unpleasant dream before sleep isn’t fun
[11:16:36]  maxifyer: Honestly, I'm probably the craziest guy here rn LUL
[11:16:41]  cosmicmikan: yes
[11:17:42]  haine_sense1: It’s particularly weird because I’m pretty sure the dream was supposed to be set in the room I’m currently sleeping in so it’s even more weird
[11:18:11]  kaeos: I think normal scale in this chat goes from random chicks that show up every few months that you know for some reason and then the other side of the scale is the unnamed superhero and the other people that explicitly want to fuck you
[11:18:40]  zwonnnn: i came here for the abusive mods
[11:18:51]  cosmicmikan: oh, i'll abuse you alright
[11:19:00]  kaeos: ?
[11:19:03]  cosmicmikan: we're playing league rn
[11:19:11]  haine_sense1: Question: were you thinking of me with the “people that explicitly want to fuck you”
[11:19:45]  kaeos: I don't think of you ever
[11:19:59]  cosmicmikan: if there such thing as 'fun' in league?
[11:19:59]  haine_sense1: Probably a good thing
[11:20:11]  chef_zack: there is fun in league
[11:20:46]  kaeos: I've tried to play league 3 times and uninstalled before the end of the tutorial every time
[11:21:17]  haine_sense1: Oh wait, there was that person who asked for what was it? If they paid you or something?
[11:21:30]  kaeos: it's super boring though
[11:21:41]  haine_sense1: Guess they probably fit the explicitly want to fuck you more than me
[11:22:31]  haine_sense1: Like, I can’t remember they asked for something like “private images” or something similarly weird but not particularly specific
[11:23:17]  haine_sense1: ah that one
[11:23:38]  kaeos: that's good money though
[11:23:45]  kaeos: send some random dick u found online
[11:23:51]  haine_sense1: Lolol
[11:24:07]  maxifyer: DId you know there is a fetish where you pay a dominatrix to blackmail you and if you don't do as she says, she'll expose the perv you are to your friend, family and/or boss or whatever
[11:24:20]  kaeos: I did not know, thank you
[11:25:02]  kaeos: I'll be sure to share this information with my close friends and family
[11:25:17]  maxifyer: LUL
[11:25:23]  haine_sense1: wouldn’t you prefer if a dominatrix did that for you?
[11:25:52]  kaeos: this whomp keeps dying only for you to choke and come back and kill him again
[11:26:12]  maxifyer: Pretty much. Online dommes are much cheaper though
[11:26:51]  kaeos: I'm gonna go take a shower and also rinse my eyes out from reading this chat today :)
[11:27:28]  cosmicmikan: same.
[11:27:58]  haine_sense1: I didn’t go to sleep.
[11:28:03]  haine_sense1: Why do I do this
[11:29:02]  johnny3oak: ?
[11:29:10]  maxifyer: LUL
[11:29:30]  cosmicmikan: dont ask
[11:29:32]  johnny3oak: clip it and ship it lads
[11:29:53]  haine_sense1: Oh how useful - it all talked about dominatrixes I only one (male) dominators
[11:29:56]  maxifyer: I mean, you could start an onlyfans if you reach 1000 followeres LUL
[11:30:50]  haine_sense1: want*
[11:31:03]  maxifyer: LUL
[11:31:50]  haine_sense1: No comment
[11:32:03]  haine_sense1: (On the only fans comments)
[11:32:40]  haine_sense1: Lol
[11:33:25]  haine_sense1: Wait… do I actually still have that clip of you showing your feet saved on my computer somewhere or did I delete it immediately?
[11:34:52]  haine_sense1: Hopefully I deleted it
[11:35:28]  maxifyer: LUL
[11:36:27]  maxifyer: Zetto, have you ever gambled=
[11:36:30]  maxifyer: ?
[11:37:04]  maxifyer: What!? Gambling is illegal in Japan!? :O
[11:37:22]  laurabraus: is even playing online slot games illegal if no real money is involved?
[11:39:03]  maxifyer: Is it illegal in all of Japan or just some prefectures?
[11:39:25]  maxifyer: Why!?
[11:39:34]  maxifyer: Why would you ever ban people from gambling?
[11:39:51]  maxifyer: That's your responsibility
[11:40:01]  maxifyer: Government shouldn't forbit it because of that
[11:40:12]  haine_sense1: Anyway, I’ll stop talking about stuff that makes you awkward and means you intentionally don’t read my messages in chat out loud.
[11:41:11]  laurabraus: @MaxiFyer then dont move to japan ez
[11:41:13]  haine_sense1: And go to sleep
[11:42:35]  maxifyer: I've actually been thinking lately about not moving there for reasons like that
[11:42:48]  maxifyer: Like they've banned modding your own game console ffs!
[11:42:56]  maxifyer: You can go to jail for it! That is utterly ridicolous!
[11:43:30]  maxifyer: Yes. Modding your game console is illegal in Japan
[11:43:33]  maxifyer: Since a few years back
[11:44:24]  laurabraus: lots of people moving from overseas to japan apparently dislike how small living spaces are and also having to use the train to get everywhere but both of those are appealing to me? and also having to dry your clothes outside
[11:44:25]  maxifyer: I'm pretty sure they're referring to running unsigned code, making you able to run backups etc
[11:45:16]  maxifyer: If it's just an LED mod, I doubt it counts
[11:45:30]  maxifyer: But I wouldn't be surprised if that's also illegal...
[11:47:28]  maxifyer: What I've been wondering though is, if I buy a console from Japan, then mod it in a different country and then go back to Japan with that modded console, is that illegal?
[11:47:54]  haine_sense1: Laws about technology/software in general tend to be pretty stupidly written
[11:49:32]  haine_sense1: Well…… is owning a modded console illegal?
[11:49:48]  usausachu: !lurk on pc
[11:49:48]  nightbot: bye bitch
[11:50:49]  haine_sense1: Oh come on… WHY AM I STILL HERE?? bye I am turning my phone off immediately after sending this message
[11:51:02]  laurabraus: goodnight haine sleep well
[11:51:31]  maxifyer: Etiher way, a roulette dealer said that in his experience, the best way to win at roulette is to bet on two dozens (one dozen pays 2:1). I've done the maths and it's roughly 65% chance of winning if you do that! The downside is that if you lose you lose twice as much as you would have won. I think this may work in the short term but not for long
[11:53:11]  laurabraus: this is totally off topic, but once i heard that chewing gum in japan isnt really popular or sold? because its rude when you spit it out/spit anything out. is that true
[11:54:08]  maxifyer: Actually, that's not entirely true. Card counting works in the long term. And no, it's not illegal bc you're only using your brain
[11:54:27]  laurabraus: oh okay cool one less thing to worry about
[11:55:14]  kaeos: hey zetto im thinking of quitting my job and dropping out of school to pursue smash full time
[11:55:22]  maxifyer: That's true. The casino will kick you out LUL but you're still legally allowed to cash out
[11:55:46]  maxifyer: DON'T!
[11:55:46]  laurabraus: @kaeos do it
[11:55:55]  maxifyer: There is no guarantee you'll make it
[11:56:05]  kaeos: yes there is
[11:56:07]  kaeos: im the best
[11:56:15]  maxifyer: Are you joking now?
[11:56:24]  kaeos: no
[11:56:36]  laurabraus: kaeos never jokes. ever. nope. would never lie. or exaggerate
[11:56:41]  maxifyer: I assume you're talking about becoming pro, right?
[11:56:45]  maxifyer: as in e-sports
[11:56:52]  cosmicmikan: oki i have to go for nowww!

[11:57:11]  maxifyer: If that's the case at least get a part time job and practice on your leisure time
[11:57:20]  laurabraus: no just go full smash
[11:57:27]  maxifyer: That's so dumb
[11:57:28]  laurabraus: a TRUE gamble
[11:58:04]  kaeos: i cant believe youre doubting my prowess
[11:58:29]  laurabraus: kaeos will you stream yourself winning tournaments
[11:58:35]  laurabraus: or more importantly losing
[11:58:39]  laurabraus: :)
[11:58:49]  kaeos: no i dont stream

[11:59:00]  laurabraus: then how can i support you
[11:59:03]  maxifyer: I mean you're not wrong. It's basicaly the same as the britt who sold everything he owned and bet all of his money on red... and won! Except the odds are probably much worse than that!
[11:59:25]  kaeos: you can support by subscribing to my onlyfans
[11:59:34]  laurabraus: the worse the odds THE BETTER THE GAMBLE

[12:01:07]  maxifyer: I woulnd't be surprised if people payed for that just for the memes LUL

[12:02:50]  pulsejp: Anatomy Pog
[12:03:03]  maxifyer: Anyway, I'm gonna simulate a scenario now where I have 1000 kr(my currency) and I'm gambling on roulette using that strategy(two dozens). I will use an online roulette simulator for this. If it goes well, I'll to it for real money next time I get some :)
[12:03:18]  maxifyer: I'm gonna see if I can reach 2000 doing that

[12:04:11]  maxifyer: With a 65% chance of winning, it's definately doable
[12:04:25]  maxifyer: But I COULD lose if I got unlucky LUL
[12:05:06]  kaeos: @ktrZetto you should change your twitch name to ktrZettoJP so people know youre japanese
[12:05:26]  maxifyer: The best way without counting cards is to make a huge bet with good odds, and when you're + you WALK AWAY!

[12:10:23]  maxifyer: It went to shit LUL
[12:10:43]  pulsejp: A broken man
