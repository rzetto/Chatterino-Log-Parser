[05:08:12]  laurabraus: @FrostedDiamond TRUTH
[05:09:07]  vendaraa: yes, i know you from twitch. but i don't catch your streams very often
[05:09:31]  frosteddiamond: That sounds genuinely amazing
[05:09:41]  vendaraa: well that explains lol
[05:10:07]  frosteddiamond: Nah I love sour foods
[05:10:41]  laurabraus: it depends what it is
[05:10:59]  laurabraus: those war head candies were pretty good
[05:11:28]  frosteddiamond: @laurabraus right right?! loved those things
[05:12:21]  laurabraus: i think you're thinking of air heads
[05:12:28]  laurabraus: i never had air heads i dont think
[05:12:58]  frosteddiamond: Air heads are really good, even got the small candy set which is nice
[05:13:11]  laurabraus: war heads are a really sour candy
[05:13:40]  laurabraus: i think they made a special type of war head that people would try to keep in their mouth the longest without spitting them out
[05:14:15]  laurabraus: i think a guy i went out with once gave me air heads gum when i left LMAO
[05:14:25]  laurabraus: i didnt like takis either way too spicy
[05:14:28]  laurabraus: same with spicy cheetos
[05:14:39]  frosteddiamond: Takis are bland imo, but Dinamitas are spicier and I love it
[05:16:14]  laurabraus: im not a fan of doritos but theyre probably the top snack in america
[05:17:29]  frosteddiamond: I dont think I've seen somebody buy doritos in years
[05:18:01]  laurabraus: @FrostedDiamond REALLY?
[05:18:06]  kirosthegreat: Why do you know statistics on chip sales? orooHmm
[05:18:21]  frosteddiamond: No the top fritos brand chips is Cheetos
[05:19:24]  frosteddiamond: Cheetos ends up sold out in the stores every so often, or pringles
[05:19:25]  laurabraus: okay i looked it up and m&ms are actually the most popular snack
[05:20:26]  laurabraus: most popular chips are kettle chips which i definitely believe
[05:20:57]  laurabraus: THE CRUNCH

[05:30:36]  laurabraus: damn. idk
[05:31:08]  laurabraus: i kind of want to say 200 years LOL
[05:31:19]  laurabraus: TWENTY LMAO
[05:31:39]  kirosthegreat: Probably sometime in the next 3,000 years. We've come very close to a mass extinction event on a few occasions. Won't be long unless there's a fundamental change in humanity.
[05:31:47]  laurabraus: man what a special thing that would be. to be there when humanity meets its doom
[05:32:33]  kaeos: !lurk
[05:32:33] kaeos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months!
[05:34:26]  laurabraus: well with your timeline we probably will be there
[05:35:01]  laurabraus: yeah
[05:37:35]  laurabraus: ???
[05:38:19]  kirosthegreat: Technically, even if we end ourselves, survival of the fittest will almost guarantee another intelligent species rises to modern standards. So long as other life can still make it, we'll be good. Here's hoping that won't be necessary tho. Earth only has another 100-400 million years in a habitable zone before the sun gets too hot
[05:38:55]  laurabraus: LMAO
[05:38:58]  laurabraus: are you okay
[05:39:22]  laurabraus: oh great
[05:39:33]  laurabraus: wind pipe i guess
[05:41:06]  kirosthegreat: Esophagus is for both breathing and eating. After the epiglottis is where you get diverging tracts
[05:41:50]  kirosthegreat: Chicken is delicious
[05:43:53]  kirosthegreat: How are you liking twitch con Kappa
[05:44:25]  kirosthegreat: I heard there was a ballpit with not enough balls YEP
[05:45:03]  kirosthegreat: I don't know what streamers are
[05:46:28]  kirosthegreat: Not how I expected a porn star to break her tailbone...
[05:48:00]  kirosthegreat: Don't judge americans. We do things diff here.
[05:49:21]  laurabraus: that sounds awful
[05:49:47]  laurabraus: EW
[05:49:51]  kirosthegreat: I forgot if we need a permit before posting a link orooHmm
[05:50:15]  kirosthegreat: Everyone I know has one of these in their closet https://media.tenor.com/85qnGJ8iAskAAAAd/robot-chicken-hump.gif
[05:50:45]  kirosthegreat: Imagine speed running WutFace
[05:52:11]  kirosthegreat: This run is amazing usausaNodders
[05:53:48]  kirosthegreat: Ehhh, something came up very recently. She's being kinda tight lipped about it, but I figure everyone has something they don't feel excited to share. Just hope everything's going alright
[05:54:23]  kirosthegreat: virtually meeting a virtual youtuber YEP
[05:57:49]  kirosthegreat: A few streamers I mod for told me to come see them for an autograph... They're cool and would love to see them in person, but I'm not spending a few thousand to travel out to California for a weekend LUL
[06:00:45]  kirosthegreat: I don't know how some of them afford it. Like if you're partnered, I imagine you get some incentives to make up for it, but imagine a casual twitch viewer blowing that kind of money just to -maybe- run into someone they kinda know
[06:01:46]  kirosthegreat: Great networking opportunity for up and coming streamers I guess
[06:02:33]  kirosthegreat: usausaNodders  Zetto is one of my favorite cam girls
[06:03:20]  kirosthegreat: Some do a bit more than networking...
[06:03:22]  babsmcnh: YOOOOO
[06:03:37]  babsmcnh: WHATS UP PARTY PEOPLE ppHop
[06:03:43]  kirosthegreat: heya babs
[06:03:52]  babsmcnh: Hi Kiros ktrzetD
[06:03:58]  babsmcnh: How you guys doing
[06:04:45]  kirosthegreat: chillin, zetto had a terrible run. it was hilarious. I'm gonna grab a popsicle
[06:04:53]  babsmcnh: Lol
[06:05:24]  babsmcnh: I mean, most networking is friendly chat and 1% of the people you meet actually become friends
[06:05:46]  babsmcnh: It’s just more awkward because the cringe that happens during that process is live-streamed for all to see
[06:06:33]  babsmcnh: Have you gotten a sub hour since you started streaming again?
[06:07:13]  babsmcnh: Since yesterday then
[06:07:47]  babsmcnh: This time is pretty perfect for me - unfortunately I have to sleep soon since I start work EARLY tomorrow
[06:08:34]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL
[06:08:47]  babsmcnh: I have a temp job rn so my hours vary a little
[06:08:59]  babsmcnh: Buttttt I may have just gotten a job offer PauseChamp
[06:09:11]  babsmcnh: Engineering related at least
[06:09:45]  babsmcnh: My temporary job is for a barista
[06:10:10]  babsmcnh: But the offer is exactly want I wanna do, just doesn’t pay the best but it’s a good start
[06:10:29]  babsmcnh: Plus it’s a graduate program I shouldn’t be surprised about the pay
[06:10:34]  babsmcnh: monkaS
[06:10:51]  babsmcnh: WHAT
[06:10:58]  babsmcnh: it’s already super high woah
[06:11:26]  babsmcnh: I was gonna get a job in Bermuda in Jan if I couldn’t find anything else but thank you for the tip
[06:12:13]  babsmcnh: target? What the hell why do they want more people unemployed
[06:12:35]  babsmcnh: Yeah I’m just scared I’ll get a better offer within the next coming weeks
[06:12:44]  babsmcnh: Either way it’ll be good for experience
[06:13:12]  babsmcnh: How have you been though HYPERS
[06:13:41]  babsmcnh: Why cash?
[06:13:57]  babsmcnh: Ahhh
[06:14:33]  babsmcnh: I only have gold ktrzetCool
[06:15:10]  babsmcnh: Full time streamer POGGERS
[06:16:33]  babsmcnh: fees?
[06:17:04]  babsmcnh: That sucks
[06:17:28]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL
[06:17:49]  babsmcnh: Yeah i guess its better to bulk up the payment into one big check
[06:18:39]  babsmcnh: And then twitch goes bankrupt PepeLaugh all ur money gone
[06:19:19]  babsmcnh: I need to cancel my Amazon Prime soon just cuz I’m doing minimum wage work rn
[06:19:39]  babsmcnh: Need to save as much as possible nowadays Sadge
[06:20:25]  babsmcnh: When I’m a billionaire I’ll give you some of my leftovers :3
[06:20:55]  babsmcnh: wouldn’t be surprised lmfao
[06:21:30]  babsmcnh: UK is struggling with gas rn
[06:22:18]  babsmcnh: Energy too but it sucks cuz that’s the work I’m trying to go into NotLikeThis gonna be very stressful first couple of years
[06:22:57]  babsmcnh: Oof
[06:23:42]  babsmcnh: I’m just covering my entire body in blankets
[06:23:48]  babsmcnh: Napkins if need be LUL
[06:24:57]  babsmcnh: ZETTOOOO
[06:25:03]  babsmcnh: …
[06:25:21]  kaeos: if you save after getting a star, you wouldnt need to restart from the beginning every time
[06:25:25]  babsmcnh: Might need to practice that star in the future
[06:25:35]  babsmcnh: @kaeos OMEGALUL
[06:27:03]  babsmcnh: i thought I was ur enemy number 1 wtf
[06:27:35]  babsmcnh: this is the run.

[06:29:27]  babsmcnh: Actually I need to go to sleep soon so I wouldn’t even be able to watch the god run
[06:29:41]  babsmcnh: I always have hope
[06:30:09]  babsmcnh: I felt like garbage today but I had a huge smile cuz of my copious amounts of hope
[06:30:39]  babsmcnh: Job starts at 7:30 but I wanna make sure I’m early, plus I have enough time to relax getting there
[06:30:48]  babsmcnh: Sooooo maybe like 6/6:15?

[08:38:31]  laurabraus: according to my limited research just now, lack of vitamin D and not being exposed to enough germs for the immune system to strengthen as a kid can lead to more allergies and peanut allergies
