[07:04:22]  dinosaurus: This mf probably uses duolingo and fuckin Genki textbook
[07:04:31]  garlicpaper555: i want to learn Japanese so bad, but at the same time it may take me super long like i know english and arabic and french but Japanese is like i hit my limit lol
[07:04:57]  dinosaurus: garlicpaper555 did you grow up speaking arabic or did you learn it later in life?
[07:05:10]  garlicpaper555: learn it later
[07:05:21]  dinosaurus: damn thats pog. anyway japanese is a cringe language dont learn it its annoying
[07:05:35]  shotmaker93: the uro is still bigger then us dollar

[07:05:41]  shotmaker93: Euro
[07:06:19]  garlicpaper555: for you which is the hardest language to learn?
[07:06:29]  dinosaurus: yeah its a SOV language instead of SVO like english and french
[07:06:38]  garlicpaper555: for me its super mario 64
[07:06:39]  dinosaurus: apparently arabic is often VSO language which is WILD
[07:07:19]  dinosaurus: Bro I dont like anime, i dont plan on travelling to japan, but here I am learning the language for seemingly no reason Sadge
[07:07:24]  chisasfam: @Dinosaurus Genki textbook T-T my tutor told me to use it but I was like no I dont want textbooks
[07:07:25]  dinosaurus: its because my community college doesnt teach korean
[07:08:21]  chisasfam: my hardest language to learn was english ngl... Idk why, I have had an easier time learning Japanese and Im picking stuff up easier than I did when learning english
[07:08:52]  shotmaker93: at some point you gotta ask yourself, is it worth it to learn a new language to just bang girls?

[07:10:28]  chisasfam: The tutors set their own rates
[07:10:30]  dinosaurus: im sure she is a contractor and thus has no rights lmao
[07:10:53]  shotmaker93: i mean keeping the rate lower you get more costumers
[07:11:12]  shotmaker93: no like 10

[07:47:32]  chisasfam: wants to ask zetto a question
[07:47:45]  kaeos: oh i havent even played online yet just the shooting range
[07:47:45]  chisasfam: you cant play ranked ino valo until you get to level 20
[07:48:44]  chisasfam: is wondering if zetto has ever eaten a thing that goes woo then also bounces off the verticle isololie of the state of wyoming! it is kind of crazy once you think about the statistical properties of the matter
[07:49:41]  shotmaker93: weel of fortune time out with the vocals to guess
[07:49:41]  kaeos: u ever play those sex games on newgrounds?
[07:49:52]  chisasfam: @kaeos yes next question
[07:49:59]  kaeos: good times
[07:50:39]  chisasfam: Kissabooba
[07:50:48]  shotmaker93: steam sells them and you're a tool if you bought them
[07:51:06]  chisasfam: toowl
[07:51:16]  chisasfam: "people bought them for me"
[07:51:34]  shotmaker93: Zetto you can get that shit for free
[07:52:35]  kaeos: do you have add incentives that other streamers are getting
[07:52:37]  kaeos: ad

[07:53:13]  shotmaker93: no god damn it
[07:53:39]  kaeos: this is the only channel im subbed to so id love to see the non subbed people get fucked bc it doesnt affect me
[07:54:11]  shotmaker93: what a rodent!

[07:55:55]  shotmaker93: @KirosTheGreat you're gonna get caught aat some point stop that
[07:56:10]  kaeos: you had one but u banned him ...
[07:56:34]  kirosthegreat: There are substantially fewer mommies out there willing to lay down a grand at a time just to make a streamer happy Sadge
[07:57:06]  kirosthegreat: twitch math is hard
[07:58:11]  kaeos: the data shows that americans spend and donate more to twitch streamers so u need to lose that EU viewership for some NA
[07:59:12]  kaeos: idk u just attract a lot of europeans
[07:59:13]  shotmaker93: you tried ;)
[07:59:15]  iop4everdudes: I'm in UK and its midnight right now

[08:01:11]  kirosthegreat: Target audience is anyone who has a thing for Italian plumbers breaking physics
[08:01:22]  shotmaker93: ye
[08:01:27]  kaeos: maybe its so many europeans bc mario is italian

[08:09:51]  cosmicmikan: ahh classic chat
[08:10:08]  cosmicmikan: i just got up from a nap i cant think yet
[08:10:15]  kaeos: @Shotmaker93 how
[08:10:28]  kirosthegreat: One of the bigger art streamers I watch only watches hentai. And she's a vtuber. I can see a pattern emerging   orooHmm
[08:10:31]  shotmaker93: think about it*
[08:10:32]  kaeos: if i want to jerk off to a girl with 4 arms then thats literally impossible with porn
[08:10:51]  shotmaker93: you fap to mortalk kombat!?
[08:10:57]  shotmaker93: mortal*
[08:11:01]  anglerangus: i only watch hentai
[08:11:05]  kaeos: no
[08:11:19]  kirosthegreat: Pfft, no shit she only watches hentai. But we had a discussion about it in Squ's chat like a month ago
[08:11:50]  iop4everdudes: do most people prefer hentai or live action audio visuals?
[08:11:57]  kaeos: i dont jerk off to cartoons
[08:12:15]  shotmaker93: lies
[08:12:28]  kirosthegreat: Emu doesn't follow me on twitter. But then I don't use twitter sooo rikkuSit
[08:12:46]  kirosthegreat: Networking is the best way to grow. Something everyone has to do
[08:13:24]  iop4everdudes: does zetto hate live action(judging by the way you answered)
[08:14:56]  kaeos: i dont think anyone from your raids ever says anything in the chat
[08:15:05]  kaeos: plus theyre sometimes follow only and no shot im following
[08:15:42]  kirosthegreat: To be fair, there's a large difference in appeal between anime and cartoons. It's not something that can be compared as a medium. Plenty of rage wars going on the net regarding that
[08:16:12]  kaeos: anime and cartoons are basically the same
[08:16:15]  kirosthegreat: Zetto the toxic streamer Kapp
[08:16:42]  shotmaker93: Zetto keep it real no asskissing
[08:16:55]  kaeos: i think that if you think theyre different then ur just a weeb
[08:17:53]  kirosthegreat: I mean, titanic is a film, and so is an art student's 30 second movie about an egg dripping on a counter, but the two are /not/ comparable
[08:18:09]  shotmaker93: i trust you
