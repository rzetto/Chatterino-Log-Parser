[10:45:05]  chisasfam: I will make more for you when I reinstall vegas
[10:46:10]  chisasfam: I struggle with tiktoks its annoying, its so dumb
[10:46:20]  chisasfam: vegas sucks for mobile video

[10:47:12]  chisasfam: computer stuff and stuff to be uploaded at like computer resoluations
[10:47:12]  kaeos: it's for movies
[10:47:16]  chisasfam: Yeah
[10:47:59]  chisasfam: Vegas is easier to use its better for people who are new to editing / youtubers and marketers
[10:48:06]  chisasfam: and early level film makers
[10:48:25]  chisasfam: but Music videos and full movies and stuff its probably best to use for premiere pro
[10:48:54]  chisasfam: I always used vegas, in my old job I was forced to use premiere and I hated it
[10:49:07]  laurabraus: premiere is a lot
[10:49:22]  chisasfam: free trial on different accounts

[10:52:38]  chisasfam: yeah I can make a template
[10:52:59]  chisasfam: but you need to like restart vegas when you do
