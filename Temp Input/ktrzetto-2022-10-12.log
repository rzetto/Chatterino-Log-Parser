[10:53:55]  chisasfam: even then most of us dont really watch tv
[10:54:00]  kaeos: "u got a license to watch that television?" LULW
[10:54:30]  shotmaker93: can't be worst than China
[10:54:56]  asimplyokgamer: I’m not really in an area they’d wanna hit. It’d start shit with Mexico too
[10:55:01]  chisasfam: the UK nuke hotspots are Liverpool , Manchester, London , Glasgow and Edinbrugh
[10:55:36]  chisasfam: you can just say "I dont watch tv" and they cant really prove that you do unless they see you doing it
[10:56:06]  kaeos: why arent you playing overwatch 2
[10:56:53]  kaeos: theres probably enough nukes to terraform mars
[10:57:12]  asimplyokgamer: It’s cause Reynosa mexico is like right next to where I am so if I get nuked here, it’d get Reynosa too
[10:57:43]  kaeos: im willing to bet world leaders are egotistical enough to not care
[10:57:56]  chisasfam: the primary reason for nukes isnt really to cause mass death , its to cause a huge humaritarian crisis, lack of food, recourses, over capacity hospitals ,
[10:58:21]  chisasfam: bc that causes the ppl to get angry and stressed, starting public disorder
[10:58:43]  shotmaker93: life is already like this with no nukes tbh?
[10:58:43]  kaeos: ok but thats not an issue if they just kill everyone
[10:59:19]  chisasfam: and nukes will mostly target , refineries, Data centres, Farms and Mills , and major air bases
[10:59:24]  kaeos: this dude does owlful 😂
[10:59:34]  kaeos: mexico is allied with the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
[11:00:20]  chisasfam: it depends on the country
[11:00:29]  asimplyokgamer: Mexico is entangled in a war against the cartels and its wild. We got an 18 wheeler freezer storage seized at the border full of childrens organs and bodies
[11:00:32]  chisasfam: If America gets nuked itll hurt their ego so theyll probably go all out
[11:01:21]  chisasfam: "I can save that 5 seconds in movement" - chesG
[11:01:55]  shotmaker93: @ASimplyOkGamer that's fuckt
