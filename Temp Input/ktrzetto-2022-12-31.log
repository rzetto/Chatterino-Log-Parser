[13:24:37]  kirosthegreat: Buying into a new coin is dangerous rikkuThisisfine
[13:27:12]  kirosthegreat: "YOU CAN'T HATCH?"
[13:29:32]  kirosthegreat: I think Logan loves money more than the average person orooStare
[13:30:54]  kirosthegreat: It's just like I see Logan doing -anything- that's wild for lots of cash. So I'd be reeeeally skeptical of something like this.
[13:33:04]  kirosthegreat: Held what hostage?
[13:33:36]  kirosthegreat: That doesn't make sense though... It's a decentralized blockchain
[13:33:39]  kirosthegreat: exactly
[13:33:41]  kirosthegreat: alkasndfkne
[13:34:40]  kirosthegreat: It's a fork. Of. A preexisting blockchain. What. The hell.

[13:41:34]  pervaritasuprema: they should hire me
[13:41:40]  kirosthegreat: YOUR JOB IS WHAT I SAY IT IS... sir this is a Wendy's
[13:43:09]  kirosthegreat: Nah, this is just discussion. He's at liberty to say literally anything that's gone on and what he suspects is happening. There's no ethics board for youtube creators rikkuUwu
[13:45:33]  kirosthegreat: I'll manage developers and abandon a project for 1 million dollars. Try me. I'll do it.
[13:49:41]  kirosthegreat: Yeeeeah, I wouldn't have believed that he was an MIT grad, location doxxing hacker extraordinaire that the CIA desperately hired if he CAN'T PAY HIS RENT

[13:53:32]  kirosthegreat: That's not a fatigue bar... that's a health bar orooHmm
[13:54:39]  kirosthegreat: I'd have more faith if they said machine learning was used to predict injuries and burnout rather than some guy who thinks of street fighter
[13:55:26]  mchamy: Logan Paul has scammed people multiple times yet people still believe him LUL
[13:55:39]  kirosthegreat: Shit, maybe I should become a lying narcissist. Seems to work out for some people.
[13:57:05]  kirosthegreat: I might be able to live with myself for several million dollars pinkshUwu
[14:00:56]  kirosthegreat: Logan Paul also ruined pokemon card collecting. There's no fucking way I can afford an unopened box of gen 1 cards now sayuwuSus
[14:02:53]  kirosthegreat: The demand TOOK OFF after Logan released some videos of how expensive and exclusive his box of first edition cards were. And the collective internet lost their shit when he opened all of them orooCry
[14:06:39]  kirosthegreat: Gotta love when someone's ego gets the best of them
