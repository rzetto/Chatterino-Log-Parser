[10:00:53]  chisasfam: live
[10:01:00]  kaeos: from what i can tell based on the popular sm64 streamers like clint and now squeex, u need either good stories or a funny chat to bounce off
[10:01:55]  chisasfam: literally, its hard bc you need a good chat to be entertaining bc its hard to be entertaining with like 0-1 viewers
[10:02:28]  chisasfam: zetto ill make you laugh rn okay
[10:02:33]  kaeos: im more on the side of miz's party than trainwrecks' bc i dont trust someone morally corrupt enough to peddle gambling to children
