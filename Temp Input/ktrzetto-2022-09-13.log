[11:56:47]  kaeos: i actually like the weapons breaking in botw
[11:57:33]  koffeekraken: yup
[11:58:22]  koffeekraken: Weapon breaking forces you to try new weapons
[12:00:18]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice.

[12:07:11]  kaeos: it's incredibly useful
[12:07:12]  itsaystrueno: does this floating set of eyes look trustworthy to you?
[12:08:15]  koffeekraken: As rule of exp I will tell you this. The trials always have good cards.  The probability of sigil trial is very good based on your deck
[12:09:31]  koffeekraken: yeah, 4 losses was def a cap. LUL
[12:10:08]  koffeekraken: 1 and 3 are good
