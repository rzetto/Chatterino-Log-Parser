[06:25:47]  haine_sense1: why?
[06:25:48]  babsmcnh: yeah im okay
[06:25:58]  babsmcnh: zetto taught me it
[06:26:02]  andrewangus: im stuck on a hw question
[06:26:13]  andrewangus: 174 business executives were surveyed to determine if they regularly read Fortune, Time, or Money magazines. 71 read Fortune, 75 read Time, 43 read Money, 48 read exactly two of the three magazines, 25 read Fortune and Time, 25 read Time and Money, and 2 read all three magazines. How many read none of the three magazines?
[06:26:18]  andrewangus: YEP
[06:26:34]  haine_sense1: basically, you include everyone, then after a while, you exclude them for no reason to make them feel like they're worthless
[06:26:37]  robertzarmy: just do math
[06:26:41]  haine_sense1: ^
[06:26:42]  andrewangus: 5Head
[06:26:43]  babsmcnh: have you drawn the diagram for it
[06:26:56]  andrewangus: ya i just dont know how to get the union between fortune and money
[06:27:23]  babsmcnh: no one reads fortune and money both
[06:27:26]  robertzarmy: i need help creating a memo that outlines the advantages and disadvantages of deception instruments
[06:27:39]  andrewangus: monkaS
[06:27:51]  babsmcnh: like for that subset its 0
[06:28:01]  andrewangus: are you sure monkaHmm

[06:28:42]  robertzarmy: im literally better than u at japanese
[06:28:42]  babsmcnh: no wait
[06:28:51]  babsmcnh: it might be 2?
[06:29:03]  andrewangus: wait i think it is 0
[06:29:06]  robertzarmy: is this linear calculus
[06:29:44]  babsmcnh: if its 48 and its (52-2) +(25-2) +2 its be 48 right
[06:29:51]  babsmcnh: yeah its zero
[06:29:58]  robertzarmy: 1/2(b x h)
[06:29:59]  babsmcnh: i just doubted myself for a second
[06:30:14]  babsmcnh: both are supposed to be 25 sorry lmao
[06:30:15]  nightbot: What's up, local degenerate shillbot here to tell you that if you have Amazon Prime, you can link it with your Twitch account for a free sub!
[06:30:15]  robertzarmy: 0%
[06:30:20]  babsmcnh: you have a high chance
[06:30:25]  saltychildofthesea: nonzero id say
[06:30:50]  robertzarmy: base 100% minus the zetto factor which is -100%
[06:31:02]  babsmcnh: but unfortunately i cant guarantee ur chances of getitng laid PepoG it seems as if im dividing by zero for this calculation
[06:31:16]  andrewangus: is ÂàÜ„Åã„Çã the same as „Çè„Åã„Çã monkaHmm
[06:31:27]  robertzarmy: yeah?
[06:31:34]  saltychildofthesea: take P(x) and multiply it by zero (the zetto number)
[06:31:37]  robertzarmy: one just has the kanji
[06:31:46]  saltychildofthesea: nvm P(x) = 0%
[06:31:46]  babsmcnh: ahhh salty hmm
[06:31:50]  babsmcnh: LMAO
[06:31:58]  andrewangus: wonder why it doesn't show up on jp keyboard autocomplete ü§î
[06:32:08]  robertzarmy: it does.
[06:32:18]  andrewangus: oh you gotta hit space twice
[06:32:25]  babsmcnh: WEIRD
[06:32:28]  andrewangus: arigatou Prayge
[06:32:29]  crab_father: its all sounds
[06:32:34]  babsmcnh: srry i had capslock on
[06:32:49]  babsmcnh: you'll get a girl one day man
[06:32:52]  crab_father: kanji helps differentiate in sentences though
[06:33:00]  babsmcnh: i just hope its not a shit relationship
[06:33:13]  robertzarmy: kanji is for those weak of mind
[06:34:23]  babsmcnh: no one saw that.
[06:34:31]  saltychildofthesea: Prayge frame perfect ground pound = good relationship
[06:34:34]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL
[06:34:41]  babsmcnh: im sorry lmao
[06:35:06]  babsmcnh: nah i know some stuff
[06:35:09]  babsmcnh: i was distracted
[06:35:14]  haine_sense1: |F| = 71, |T| = 75, |M| = 43; 48 = |F ‚à© T| + |F ‚à© M| + |T ‚à© M| - 3|F ‚à© T ‚à© M|,  |F ‚à© T| = 25, |T ‚à© M| = 25, |F ‚à© T ‚à© M| = 2 |F ‚à™ T ‚à™ M| = |F| + |T| + |M| - |F ‚à© T| - |F ‚à© M| - |T ‚à© M| + |F ‚à© T ‚à© M| = 71 + 75 + 43 - 25 - 25 - 4 + 2 = 137 So 174 - 137 = 37 is the answer unless I made a mistake which is highly likely
[06:35:27]  chef_zack: whomps is probably my most watched stage
[06:35:38]  saltychildofthesea: jesus i got a heart attack looking at that
[06:35:51]  robertzarmy: zetto is my most looked at face
