[10:40:22]  kaeos: why arent your logos gay colored for pride month?
[10:40:47]  haine_sense1: Lol
[10:40:54]  laurabraus: too lazy to be gay
[10:40:55]  kaeos: ktrzetto hates the gays
[10:41:14]  robertzarmy: dude has a max DK he just sucks
[10:41:14]  laurabraus: cancelled
[10:42:02]  robertzarmy: this why i play DPS
[10:42:09]  robertzarmy: I deal damage and nobody can get mad at me
[10:42:09]  haine_sense1: Nah, kaeos, he’s standing out from all the people who make their logos gay for pride month — showing that he isn’t like those people who just follow the crowd
[10:42:24]  kaeos: not like the other streamers PogChamp
[10:42:39]  laurabraus: not like other streamers. homophobic instead
[10:42:44]  kaeos: TRUE
[10:42:47]  haine_sense1: YEP
[10:42:52]  robertzarmy: LOL I am always top 2 damage. Without fail
[10:42:55]  robertzarmy: it's a point of pride.
[10:43:13]  kaeos: robert are you an mmo nerd
[10:43:30]  haine_sense1: i get the feeling that he is
[10:43:43]  robertzarmy: no I'm not even max level in this game
[10:43:47]  robertzarmy: zetto probably has double my hours
[10:43:49]  kaeos: oh
[10:43:52]  kaeos: so it zetto just bad
[10:44:02]  haine_sense1: Also makes sense
[10:45:09]  robertzarmy: let me pull up the logs
[10:45:37]  kaeos: collab with robert when
[10:45:40]  kaeos: let him carry u in pvp
[10:46:59]  kaeos: sounds like u should play wow isntead
[10:47:12]  robertzarmy: okay it really depends
[10:47:28]  robertzarmy: ideally healer should be lowest dps but it just depends how good they are
[10:48:48]  kaeos: try tf2 pvp :)
[10:48:55]  robertzarmy: try Apex legends PVP
[10:49:08]  robertzarmy: also I could definitely run dailies with zetto
[10:50:21]  robertzarmy: it is an important skill for a healer to know when to heal so that they do not pull too much aggro.
[10:50:37]  kaeos: apex legends was designed to be unfun
[10:50:47]  robertzarmy: for noobs
[10:51:37]  kaeos: hey thats a wooly mammoth
[10:51:43]  kaeos: theyre an endangered species D:
[10:51:52]  robertzarmy: WHATEVER WILL YOU DO WITHOUT ASSIZE
[10:52:39]  303devilfish: divine venison Pog
[10:52:50]  robertzarmy: level 50 is so boring for me too lmfao
[10:53:05]  robertzarmy: I play reaper and all I have to do is just click the glowy buttons
[10:53:13]  kaeos: when are you collabing with tyler1
[10:53:54]  kaeos: it is NEVER the tanks fault
[10:54:02]  robertzarmy: okay thats the dps fault
[10:54:05]  robertzarmy: dps should have pulled that
[10:54:13]  kaeos: see i know what im talking about
[10:54:28]  robertzarmy: ANYONE SHOULD HAVE PULLED IT BUT YOU
[10:54:34]  robertzarmy: you could have dragged it to the tank too
[10:55:01]  robertzarmy: you unmoving sack of meat
[10:55:16]  kaeos: move
[10:55:53]  robertzarmy: yea cause youre healing before the tank aggros
[10:55:58]  robertzarmy: you gross healer
[10:56:20]  robertzarmy: this guy is neat
[10:56:27]  kaeos: i only know about aggro from all the mmo isekai ive watched
[10:57:01]  robertzarmy: why are you even doing dailies aren't you max level
[10:58:04]  kaeos: cant you get money by buying it
[10:58:28]  kaeos: sounds like a reason to play wow
[10:58:38]  robertzarmy: mages when they can't sit completely still and do nothing the entire fight
[10:58:44]  robertzarmy: this is coming from the mage hater gang
[10:59:28]  robertzarmy: sitting completely still and channeling is so boring
[10:59:34]  kaeos: from what i can infer, mages are massive pussies
[10:59:36]  robertzarmy: reaper gang
[10:59:45]  robertzarmy: MELEE GANG

[11:01:04]  kaeos: black mage is my favorite
[11:01:13]  kaeos: i mained black mage in super smash flash
[11:02:34]  robertzarmy: BLM you literally place down a stationary ley line that you cant move from or you deal less damage
[11:02:41]  robertzarmy: its the epitome of sitting still and channeling
[11:03:03]  kaeos: CLM ✊
[11:04:00]  kaeos: cuck lives matter
[11:04:03]  robertzarmy: I used to play dancer but apparently dancer is just bad
[11:05:04]  robertzarmy: dancer has the lowest DPS of all DPS at high levels by a lot
[11:05:33]  robertzarmy: even more than the buff characters like bard
[11:05:35]  kaeos: dancer is sheik ?
[11:05:59]  robertzarmy: dancer is really fucking easy though
[11:06:09]  usausachu: hey bro

[11:07:03]  robertzarmy: the trial finished today
[11:07:10]  tnpee: i mean dnc is the best rdps ranged job
[11:07:17]  tnpee: under blm
[11:07:45]  robertzarmy: its possible it changed but it definitely was the worst dps
[11:07:49]  robertzarmy: when I played
[11:08:26]  tnpee: it wasnt great for this savage tier but its pref over bard for dsr cause of downtime
[11:08:33]  kaeos: is anyone else dropping frames or just me
[11:08:40]  tnpee: wow ktr this is just like you're progging dsr
[11:08:55]  tnpee: the newest ultimate is dsr/dsu
[11:08:59]  robertzarmy: what is the most recent patch
[11:09:14]  tnpee: 6.11
[11:10:28]  robertzarmy: google shows that dancer is still the bottom as far as pure dps goes
[11:10:34]  robertzarmy: but idk how accurate it is
[11:10:56]  robertzarmy: also this is totally the cool nidhogg fight
[11:11:46]  robertzarmy: bro why u lettin them wipe
[11:11:49]  robertzarmy: smh
[11:12:03]  robertzarmy: gg

[11:12:53]  robertzarmy: jk there was no lb3 yet
[11:13:14]  kaeos: you should do some vod review
[11:13:37]  robertzarmy: do main scenario
[11:13:40]  robertzarmy: hahahaha
[11:13:55]  tnpee: they actually kinda saved msq roulette
[11:14:54]  robertzarmy: your dude looks dumb
[11:14:59]  kaeos: KIRA TSUKI

[11:17:02]  robertzarmy: big wipe
[11:17:40]  robertzarmy: is it tech to ape the healers
[11:18:11]  kaeos: isnt reaper an overwatch character
[11:18:18]  robertzarmy: yeah
[11:19:29]  kaeos: Sam has been grinding the past 24 hours to carry ur lazy ass
[11:20:01]  kaeos: LOWER RANK THAN SAM OMEGALUL
[11:23:25]  kaeos: visually it looks like picasso took a shit on the screen

[11:28:35]  kaeos: i think the 4 player online is cool
[11:29:02]  kaeos: i think thats what it means
[11:29:19]  kaeos: apparently theres no set storyline u have to follow
[11:29:24]  kaeos: like going gym to gym
[11:29:46]  kaeos: these legendaries look TRASH
[11:29:47]  303devilfish: POGGERS
[11:29:51]  kaeos: its a fucking BIKE

[11:30:50]  kaeos: lechonk
[11:31:21]  kaeos: sword and shield was my cyberpunk
[11:32:04]  kaeos: luckily i dont need to pay for the game :)
[11:32:10]  303devilfish: i have like 250 hours in shield and like 90% of it was hatching eggs for shinies
[11:32:48]  kaeos: whenever i see someone in the pokemon sw/sh category, theyre biking in circles in the wild area hatching eggs
[11:34:05]  kaeos: rent a pidgeot to sit on your eggs
[11:34:33]  kaeos: they shoud add that
[11:35:27]  303devilfish: I didn't really care about the IV's for my shinies tho so a lot of them get one shot and do no damage
[11:35:35]  303devilfish: only like 2 or 3 are actually decent
[11:36:37]  kaeos: the farthest ill go for IVs is restarting on my starter pokemon and training EVs
[11:38:06]  303devilfish: I think the random shinies are the most hype
[11:38:13]  kaeos: you wore that mask yesterday
[11:39:26]  303devilfish: I found a shiny Alolan Meowth at the beginning of Moon and almost killed it because it barely looks different
[11:42:43]  kaeos: corviknight is so cool
[11:42:52]  kaeos: the regional birds always look cool
[11:46:11]  kaeos: this game is too big
[11:46:30]  kaeos: yeah it feels empty sometimes
[11:48:19]  kaeos: so by 4000 hours youll get it
[11:49:01]  303devilfish: just win 180 straight
[11:52:18]  303devilfish: how come they have two healers
[11:53:01]  kaeos: 5 healer meta PogChamp
