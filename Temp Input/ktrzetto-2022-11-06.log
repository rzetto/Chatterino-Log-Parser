[10:33:08]  laurabraus: i think i played this game before and this is where i stopped
[10:33:22]  laurabraus: yeah
[10:33:23]  303devilfish: it helps you get a higher score like a real gamer

[10:34:43]  kaeos: no gaming skills
[10:34:46]  laurabraus: wow...thats all i had to do
[10:34:58]  303devilfish: COPIUM
[10:35:16]  kaeos: but this isnt mario 64
[10:35:18]  kaeos: ??
[10:35:59]  kaeos: im pushing p
[10:36:39]  303devilfish: he doesn't know PepeLaugh
[10:36:52]  shotmaker93: Wario is next after Super Mario World?
[10:36:59]  kaeos: if we told you then you'd know
[10:36:59]  laurabraus: ive always thought the 2d mario games are insanely hard but im also a bad gamer
[10:37:23]  shotmaker93: there are some other Wario's beside wario land tho
[10:38:19]  laurabraus: rhythm heaven best game ever
[10:38:25]  shotmaker93: Wario World
[10:39:09]  shotmaker93: is for the gamecube
[10:39:26]  laurabraus: theres also wario land for gba
[10:39:37]  laurabraus: theres also four different rhythm heavens
[10:39:58]  kaeos: ???
[10:40:38]  shotmaker93: yea the first wario were for the game boy, wario lands for game boy color were quite hard
[10:40:43]  kaeos: they piranha plant doesnt come out if ur on the pipe in like any mario game
[10:40:56]  laurabraus: you have a wii so that one is probably the cheapest and easiest to find. theres also one for gba, ds, and 3ds
[10:41:23]  kaeos: YOU KILLED AMSA NOO
[10:42:17]  kaeos: amsa 3.5 openings per kill is cracked
[10:42:59]  303devilfish: died to a block LULW
[10:43:03]  laurabraus: emulating ds will be such a pain for rhythm heaven
[10:43:22]  laurabraus: honestly emulating any of the rhythm heaven games would be hard. except maybe gba
[10:43:40]  laurabraus: theres an english patch for the gba one because it only came out in japan originally
[10:43:53]  laurabraus: but you dont really need to see text for it
[10:44:11]  iop4everdudes: is this your first time playing SMW?
[10:44:14]  kaeos: you could just not play the rhythm heaven
[10:44:20]  kaeos: you could instead play csgo
[10:44:21]  iop4everdudes: also hi. hope you're doing good man
[10:45:09]  303devilfish: a week
[10:45:21]  kaeos: 10 hours

[10:45:44]  kaeos: holy BOOMER
[10:46:11]  303devilfish: he's not pretending PepeHands
[10:46:11]  laurabraus: omg
[10:46:12]  kaeos: my guy its a turtle
[10:46:14]  iop4everdudes: you could do it in 2 streams. if you go for 96 exits though then maybe 4-5 streams
[10:46:20]  kirosthegreat: skill issue
[10:46:45]  shotmaker93: csgo minecraft belongs to the bin
[10:46:59]  kaeos: well i said 10 hours because the average to beat it is 5 hours
[10:48:04]  kaeos: both equally bad FeelsStrongMan
[10:48:08]  shotmaker93: yo pretty generous with shrooms here
[10:48:43]  iop4everdudes: yeah, i wanted to learn the game for a bit. am focused on 64 right now, but once i get sub 2 in 120 i wanna run 96 exits for a bit
[10:49:06]  laurabraus: this game takes way more patience than i have
[10:49:41]  kaeos: youre trolling
[10:49:49]  shotmaker93: Counter Strike and Minecraft belongs to the trash bin :)
[10:49:50]  kaeos: no fine motor control
[10:50:10]  laurabraus: you've glitched past those wrecking balls like five times
[10:50:29]  laurabraus: thank god
[10:50:41]  kaeos: ü§ì
[10:50:56]  kaeos: they could just make the tiles smaller
[10:51:23]  shotmaker93: i mean this part of the game is kinda annoy you goota time time he ain't trolling
[10:51:28]  kaeos: make mario 32 tiles tall

[10:58:21]  kaeos: -1 life
[10:58:39]  laurabraus: i want you to know im laughing out loud rn
[10:58:45]  iop4everdudes: that makes no sense but I'm from the UK so
[10:58:58]  kaeos: your mom didnt carry you for 9 months for you to die to the first spiny 10 times in a row
[10:59:07]  laurabraus: was that pretend too ?
[11:00:02]  laurabraus: youre already doing better than me at this game i cant complain
[11:00:02]  nightbot: Tip me here: https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip
[11:00:34]  iop4everdudes: yo I've played this game a LOT. just press back every second or so. dont press anything in between. just press back, wait a sec. so on. holding FORWARD pushes you into the floor bro
[11:00:36]  kaeos: youre short circuiting
[11:01:30]  laurabraus: he wanted to die
[11:01:55]  kaeos: Â∏∞ÂõΩÈÖç‰ø° „Çπ„Éû„É°„Ç§„Éà
[11:02:15]  iop4everdudes: bruh you're such a joker. AMAZING game though, do NOT pass it up. I'm only like 15, so don't have the nostalgia aspect, but its still an amazing game
[11:02:22]  kaeos: yeah can u translate that
[11:02:40]  laurabraus: @iop4everdudes i forgot you are a baby
[11:03:08]  laurabraus: "you're such a joker" i dont think hes joking FeelsStrongMan
[11:03:27]  kaeos: can u translate
[11:03:28]  laurabraus: you ARE
[11:03:38]  kaeos: nah
[11:03:40]  iop4everdudes: in the original snes game(which i assume you're playing on) the dragon coins just give you 1ups and score. in the GBA version, it leads to something else. theres a SMW speedrun category called LUNAR DRAGON, where you have to get all 96 exits, all 5 dragon coins in each level, and all 3up moons
[11:03:59]  iop4everdudes: @laurabraus what, are you like 20 something?
[11:04:12]  laurabraus: @iop4everdudes yes
[11:04:13]  iop4everdudes: yeah but your playing the snes rom you knob Kappa
[11:05:04]  kaeos: can u translate this shirt https://i.gyazo.com/84591e25e50ce74892adc8458bcd3632.png
[11:05:17]  iop4everdudes: i just meant if youre on the GBA rom it would be different. but you can tell from the MODE7 affects and vivid colours that you're on snes emulator
[11:05:41]  shotmaker93: @kaeos that would be a furry shirt
[11:06:18]  kaeos: ty xqcL
[11:06:45]  kaeos: it was too complicated for google so it gave me random words
[11:07:20]  iop4everdudes: MODE7 was innovative new tech at the time where the whole screen tilts. was exclusive to SNES, not on sega megadrive or pc engine. also GBA is more washed out, you're picture is really nice you know?:)
[11:07:45]  laurabraus: BIG BOO
[11:08:03]  kaeos: boo should have been in smash
[11:08:18]  iop4everdudes: spin jump on the big boos and you don't get hurt
[11:08:46]  iop4everdudes: BTW this is just what my dad tells me. obviously i didn't know this as I'm from 2007
[11:08:50]  kaeos: he doesnt get hit by low profiles, that's his dlc privilege
[11:09:59]  kaeos: can you not comprehend people being born past 2000
[11:10:03]  laurabraus: dude thats what i was telling him hes only 15
[11:10:08]  laurabraus: i was like youre a baby
[11:10:17]  laurabraus: but man hes an encyclopedia
[11:10:26]  kaeos: games like THIS
[11:11:25]  iop4everdudes: yeah, they are. and its really boring. people at school just talk about fortnite, fifa, valorant, csgo and rocket league. when i tell them i speedrun sm64 and play a lot of JRPGS they legit don't know what I'm talking about NotATK
[11:11:41]  shotmaker93: ruinded generations
[11:11:54]  shotmaker93: not ruined
[11:13:12]  kaeos: sm64 doesnt have dwayne "the rock" johnson
[11:13:52]  kaeos: BOOMER
[11:14:23]  kaeos: yeah ok and i bet you wish gas were 50 cents a gallon again too
[11:15:22]  kaeos: i want a tesla so i dont really care what gas is
[11:15:51]  shotmaker93: what a pussy car
[11:16:08]  kaeos: best purchase in this decade
[11:16:27]  kaeos: did you have twitter stock
[11:16:30]  iop4everdudes: noice one7p

[11:17:09]  kaeos: amsa widepeepoHappy
[11:17:26]  kaeos: no he came out of the egg just now
[11:18:07]  iop4everdudes: btw zetto little tip. yoshis jump act like a spin jump(just jumping while on yoshi lets you bounce on things)
[11:19:12]  kaeos: AMSA NO D:
[11:20:07]  laurabraus: theres so many bullet bills what the hell
[11:20:37]  laurabraus: for real
[11:20:49]  laurabraus: touhou is another game i tried for like 10 min and then gave up
[11:20:59]  laurabraus: because in the old pc-98 games theres no save point
[11:21:05]  laurabraus: so you have to play it all in one sitting
[11:21:11]  laurabraus: unless i just didnt get that far
[11:21:31]  shotmaker93: Out of stock! Frying pants actions!?
[11:21:46]  laurabraus: let me look it up
[11:21:59]  shotmaker93: Can't make Zetto do his bed
[11:22:22]  iop4everdudes: bruh doesn't know where the secret exits are and keeps falling in the wat
[11:22:29]  laurabraus: yeah okay you cant save touhou games confirmed
[11:22:31]  iop4everdudes: water, but knows about the tilesets LUL
[11:22:42]  laurabraus: because the games are supposed to only take you an hour if you dont die
[11:23:18]  kaeos: ?
[11:24:32]  iop4everdudes: dude, you can just spin jump there, like you did the first time
[11:24:44]  laurabraus: gonna go get a snack brb
[11:24:44]  kaeos: you and amouranth are the same https://i.gyazo.com/f37ced437823dd9b23747f2741e20754.png
[11:25:34]  kaeos: so bad LULW
[11:25:53]  iop4everdudes: wow dude, my playtime in this game is pretty high, and i had no idea small mario couldn't break shit with spin jump lol
[11:26:16]  kaeos: ive only ever seen you and egirls with that bright green border
[11:26:38]  kaeos: and usa but she counts i guess

[11:35:07]  laurabraus: dude if you're playing on an emulator you could have quick saved so you dont have to redo everything right
[11:35:28]  laurabraus: i'm a cheater :)
[11:35:31]  kaeos: if youre playing on emulator you might as well give yourself infinite lives
[11:36:06]  laurabraus: dude ngl when i played corpse party i definitely could not have beat it without doing that
[11:36:09]  kaeos: if this is how you play the base game i cant imagine kaizo üíÄ
[11:36:29]  kaeos: isnt corpse party the guy with the really deep voice
[11:36:38]  laurabraus: thats corpse husband
[11:37:08]  laurabraus: yeah there are save points but i didnt have the patience to wait through every death cutscene like ten times
[11:37:29]  shotmaker93: play safeeeeeeeeee

[11:40:56]  shotmaker93: the racist card oh booooooo
[11:41:29]  kaeos: yes
[11:41:33]  kaeos: because i dont see color
[11:42:18]  shotmaker93: then you're colorblind, there are fixes for it
