[11:50:58]  kaeos: What is this music.
[11:51:27]  kaeos: I don't want to know the title, I meant that in a bad way.

[11:53:01]  cosmicmikan: keep it!
[11:53:16]  kaeos: You will never be Japanese. You will never find the love of your life in Japan, who looks like this and is a cutie pie Japanese girl. You will never be the protagonist in an anime. You will never have super powers that allow you to overcome your most greatest tribulations. You will always be a loser.
[11:53:37]  cosmicmikan: its ok, because truck-kun got me for the next life

[12:18:35]  cosmicmikan: fireworks scare the shit out of loki
[12:18:44]  cosmicmikan: i cant do anything
[12:19:06]  kaeos: I am spending my New Years Eve watching a lonely and depressed Japanese man play a 20 year old video game on Twitch.

[12:24:49]  agranadoe64: oops I meant only good thing
[12:24:52]  kaeos: That must be a smart child to have a therapy certification already.
[12:25:25]  cupcake_chi: Hello bums
[12:25:31]  kaeos: You're telling me a shrimp fried this rice??
[12:25:35]  agranadoe64: go outside but I can't the day ball hurts my eyes
[12:26:27]  cosmicmikan: sunscreen???????????????
[12:26:44]  cupcake_chi: I only listen to bean music and kpoop
[12:26:45]  kaeos: That's called vampires.
[12:26:46]  agranadoe64: @cosmicmikan on my eyeballs
[12:26:53]  cosmicmikan: where theres a will, theres a way
[12:26:57]  cosmicmikan: LUL
[12:27:57]  agranadoe64: @cupcake_chi soooo how the homicidal BTS stans
[12:28:19]  cosmicmikan: i was into kpop for a long ass time
[12:28:23]  cupcake_chi: Drake bell is confirmed a pedo so we don’t talk about him lmaooooo
[12:28:34]  cosmicmikan: whaat
[12:28:34]  kaeos: Please DO NOT buy the BTS meal if you don't stan them. You're preventing the actual BTS fans who have waited for months from having the BTS meal experience. Eating the sauces without understanding their significance is literally cultural appropriation and it's not okay.
[12:28:56]  agranadoe64: @kaeos even though it's just chicken nuggets
[12:29:29]  cosmicmikan: damn yall have enough money for chicken nuggets?
[12:30:54]  agranadoe64: hey this is what you say when you hate someone so much / we are saying sorry in the most sarcastic use of the word -Mooninites from aqua teen hunger force
[12:31:27]  cosmicmikan: idk i havent eaten fast food in a year or so
[12:31:27]  kaeos: If you can't even afford chicken nuggets I can PayPal you 5 bucks. :)
[12:31:33]  cosmicmikan: LMAO
[12:31:57]  cupcake_chi: Wings are fucking expensive
[12:32:17]  cosmicmikan: ooh i been making wings with the air fryer lately
[12:32:19]  cosmicmikan: so good
[12:32:57]  agranadoe64: the last time I saw a McDonald's was a month ago
[12:33:27]  cupcake_chi: Chicken oppai tho is cheap and my fav
[12:33:53]  agranadoe64: it's just I have to take care of my girlfriend microwave ramen
[12:34:13]  kaeos: An air fryer is just a convection oven.
[12:34:29]  cosmicmikan: yeah but you dont need to use much oil, so its a lot healthier
[12:34:36]  agranadoe64: they fry air
[12:34:41]  kaeos: It essentially uses air currents to spread the heat more evenly.
[12:34:51]  cosmicmikan: you can make anything in it
[12:35:37]  cupcake_chi: I am innovating new terminology
[12:35:50]  cosmicmikan: yeah, you use less
[12:36:02]  agranadoe64: okay I have to go see ya blj into another demention
[12:36:13]  cosmicmikan: yeah it cooks fast too
[12:36:32]  cosmicmikan: seeya
[12:36:37]  kaeos: It's not really much more of an upgrade from a typical oven. A lot of the hype is from being trendy.
[12:37:41]  cosmicmikan: ive only made french fries and bbq so far, i dont have many recipes yet
[12:38:34]  cosmicmikan: ktr.....
[12:38:57]  cosmicmikan: eat a balanced mealllll i beg you
[12:39:01]  kaeos: Did you make carbonara?
[12:39:17]  cosmicmikan: i hate cooking, but i like good food so
[12:39:48]  kaeos: Carbonara traditionally uses pancetta and you mentioned bacon so I thought carbonara was a decent guess.
[12:40:17]  cosmicmikan: i love salad
[12:41:55]  cosmicmikan: i like adding chicken and avacados
[12:41:58]  cupcake_chi: I love MEAT
[12:42:08]  cupcake_chi: Love meat in my mouth
[12:42:12]  cosmicmikan: sus
[12:42:40]  cosmicmikan: bleu cheese is the best
[12:42:52]  cupcake_chi: Vignarette on fruity salads
[12:43:20]  kaeos: @cupcake_chi If this is a euphemism for your homosexual tendencies just know that you are loved and accepted in this stream <3
[12:44:07]  cupcake_chi: It’s a euphemism for my affinity for protein based foods
[12:44:47]  kaeos: I see, I'm sorry for assuming.
[12:45:22]  cupcake_chi: Men are STINKY
[12:45:29]  cosmicmikan: YEAH
[12:45:58]  cupcake_chi: ggs
[12:46:16]  cosmicmikan: it is

[12:47:59]  kaeos: You're weird.
[12:48:11]  cosmicmikan: says the weirdo
[12:48:20]  kaeos: I am not weird.
[12:50:45]  cupcake_chi: 2
[12:51:36]  kaeos: West coast isn't real.
[12:51:54]  kaeos: It's a myth.
[12:52:16]  kaeos: Chuck Norris.
[12:55:11]  kaeos: You'll get it next time!
[12:55:29]  babsmcnh: Ey zetto I didn’t see this until now but I hope you’re doing well  and that your year goes amazinggggg HYPERS thanks for being such a great streamer and buddy :)

[13:58:27]  clouds617: cant get worse than this one FeelsOkayMan
[13:58:37]  cosmicmikan: don't jinx it
[13:58:37]  kaeos: I don't have a GameCube controller but I bought it ahead of time because I'm going to buy a Frame1 controller eventually.
[13:58:57]  clouds617: Youre right it can always get worse
[14:00:06]  clouds617: starting the new year off right with a healthy dose of pessimism and media scare tactics
[14:00:15]  chef_zack: panda controller got cancelled

[14:30:50]  kaeos: 600 dollars is a lot!
[14:31:10]  kaeos: You are a bum with 600 dollars, in that context it is a lot.
[14:31:53]  kaeos: Wait, if you work but don't pay any bills, how do you only have 600 dollars?
[14:31:54]  cosmicmikan: i heard you reading messages, and i could tell it was kaeos typing LMAO
[14:32:05]  kaeos: Extortion maybe?

[14:50:24]  cosmicmikan: i did not have sexual relations, with that woman, monica lewinsky
[14:51:17]  chef_zack: well it was a big power dynamic
[14:51:36]  chef_zack: you could argue that
[14:51:54]  kaeos: It's like if you started dating one of your fans (if you have any fans, I'm unsure).
[14:52:23]  kaeos: Mizkif is short.
[14:52:32]  chef_zack: well dating your fans isnt bad, its when you have other elements that make it bad
[14:52:42]  chef_zack: so like if you were to imply they could get famous or something

[14:58:01]  kaeos: Do a mukbang!!
[14:58:31]  kaeos: It's where you stuff your face with food.
[14:58:49]  kaeos: A mukbang or meokbang, also known as an eating show, is an online audiovisual broadcast in which a host consumes various quantities of food while interacting with the audience.
[14:59:30]  chef_zack: ktrzetto: today we're gonna eat 2 mcdoubles

[15:05:43]  chef_zack: i think he could do it
[15:05:54]  kaeos: If he understood the character I think he could. Not as a solo main though.
[15:05:55]  chef_zack: the insane mixup
[15:06:47]  chef_zack: i think they're the best character in the game
[15:06:52]  kaeos: He's lost with Marth at locals.
[15:06:53]  chef_zack: even with nerfs
[15:08:02]  kaeos: My top 3 is Pyra/Mythra, Joker, and Palutena.
[15:08:25]  kaeos: Ignaize.
[15:09:07]  kaeos: Ignaize or Rizeasu is the best Marth IMO (in my opinion).
[15:09:36]  chef_zack: well they keep dying to upthrow downb PepeLaugh
[15:10:13]  chef_zack: yea
[15:12:58]  yukari_cs: why the mask in your own home?

[15:35:06]  kaeos: Winning with a type advantage is dishonorable.
[15:35:34]  kaeos: The game.
[15:36:27]  chef_zack: i like mantykes smiley face
[15:36:35]  cosmicmikan: YEAH SO FUNNY
[15:37:01]  cosmicmikan: ok fine.
[15:38:01]  kaeos: You are already 30 pounds underweight.
[15:38:38]  chef_zack: whats your height?
[15:39:11]  kaeos: From Banner Health, the ideal weight for 5' 8" is 139 - 169 lbs.
[15:44:33]  cosmicmikan: i think the last time i played a pokemon game, was the original diamond
[15:45:05]  chef_zack: Pog black
[15:45:35]  kaeos: Disagree
[15:45:39]  chef_zack: out of context it sounds based
[15:45:39]  kaeos: White is supreme.
[15:45:44]  cosmicmikan: hm
[15:46:15]  chef_zack: bro thats ryu Pog
[15:46:44]  chef_zack: i thought in order to get lucario you needed to trade someone riolu
[15:46:46]  kaeos: Wait that was my first thought and I didn't consciously note that because it was so obvious it was Ryu.
[15:47:41]  kaeos: Lucario is friendship!
[15:47:56]  kaeos: Luxray :(
[15:48:00]  chef_zack: unity game OMEGALUL
[15:52:59]  cosmicmikan: why do you have to say it like that.
[15:53:13]  cosmicmikan: HAHA
[15:53:57]  kaeos: You are weird.
[15:55:36]  cosmicmikan: oh yeah?
[15:57:56]  kaeos: It's unfair how cuddling with your Pikachu is seen as cute but cuddling with your Machoke would be seen as weird.
[15:58:48]  cosmicmikan: its not weird
[15:58:52]  kaeos: You are discriminating Pokémon.
[15:59:15]  cosmicmikan: i would hug all my pokemon
[16:01:26]  cosmicmikan: i can see it
[16:01:51]  kaeos: She is unfortunately not 6'3" though.
[16:02:20]  cosmicmikan: that's hot
[16:02:28]  kaeos: 6'3" 198 pounds.
[16:02:46]  kaeos: I know this by heart.
[16:06:54]  cosmicmikan: haha really
[16:07:10]  kaeos: Source?
[16:07:24]  kaeos: No.
[16:08:20]  robertzarmy: HELLO
[16:08:31]  robertzarmy: where is your face
[16:09:08]  robertzarmy: nah keep it off
[16:09:58]  robertzarmy: I built my new computer today widepeepoHappy
[16:10:25]  robertzarmy: you're so much more enthusiastic with cam off
[16:11:01]  kaeos: No mask but camera is off seems like a thrill seeker activity.
[16:11:02]  robertzarmy: I built it for 7 hours
[16:11:57]  robertzarmy: none LUL
[16:12:05]  robertzarmy: yeah
[16:12:11]  kaeos: Congrats on building your first PC!
[16:12:17]  kaeos: It's super fun. :)
[16:12:47]  robertzarmy: 2 of it was troubleshooting and I found out my PSU doesn't have the cable I need widepeepoHappy
[16:12:54]  robertzarmy: so I never got to use it widepeepoHappy
[16:13:20]  robertzarmy: it's completely built and I need to order an adapter off amazon
[16:13:48]  robertzarmy: its semi modular
[16:14:11]  robertzarmy: I'm missing an 8pin atx and my modular part is for PCIE though
[16:14:14]  303devilfish: why are you bullying some miners
[16:14:20]  303devilfish: they're just trying to make a living
[16:14:32]  cosmicmikan: HONESTLY
[16:14:49]  robertzarmy: nah I have GPU power fine
[16:14:59]  cosmicmikan: yeah yeah thats what they always say
[16:15:02]  robertzarmy: It's some bonus 8 pin I need to plug into mobo for it to boot
[16:15:08]  kaeos: Spoiled child endorsed by world renowned Pokémon professor takes money from underpaid coal miners.
[16:16:08]  robertzarmy: I'm gonna get a 4pin + lp4 to 8pin adapter. I'm sure you know what that is
[16:17:12]  robertzarmy: it's for a molex connector
[16:17:39]  robertzarmy: I don't use it
[16:17:46]  robertzarmy: I'm just using it for the adapter LUL
[16:18:24]  robertzarmy: I'm sure it'll be fiiine
[16:18:31]  robertzarmy: it's not like I'm overclocking or anything
[16:19:31]  robertzarmy: I turn off my computer once every month or so
[16:19:38]  cosmicmikan: my mom said it would fuck my pc up to turn it off at night
[16:19:41]  cosmicmikan: i was like hello
[16:19:44]  kaeos: I only ever turn off my computer for updates.
[16:19:56]  robertzarmy: I only have a 1080 so it's probably fine for now
[16:20:02]  cosmicmikan: i dunno
[16:20:07]  cosmicmikan: i dont listen to her
[16:20:23]  robertzarmy: i just unplug it every night before i go to bed
[16:20:24]  cosmicmikan: she used to work in computers like 40 years ago
[16:21:14]  robertzarmy: this will never happen
[16:21:25]  chef_zack: this hypothetical vaccuum is truly amazing
[16:21:41]  kaeos: You're so smart!
[16:22:20]  robertzarmy: well I'm on a laptop now
[16:24:31]  robertzarmy: no cam zetto is better tbh
[16:24:56]  robertzarmy: well I already know what you look like
[16:25:06]  robertzarmy: and you're just higher energy with no cam

[16:27:38]  robertzarmy: what will you do now
[16:27:52]  robertzarmy: I didn't see it do it again
[16:28:05]  robertzarmy: I think you're lying about the dab
[16:28:14]  kaeos: Statistically, women have a higher chance of getting pregnant than men.
[16:28:38]  robertzarmy: source?
[16:28:45]  kaeos: No.

[16:31:50]  robertzarmy: I hear people really like watching dark soulls
[16:32:14]  robertzarmy: ...?
[16:32:28]  kaeos: ktrZetto seems like the type of person to spend 20 dollars on a game and not finish it.
[16:32:54]  robertzarmy: you literally said u were gonna skip half the game
[16:33:01]  cosmicmikan: i do
[16:33:23]  robertzarmy: that's not the right words to say
[16:33:32]  robertzarmy: say you're gonna beat all the bosses too
[16:34:15]  robertzarmy: you cant do this to me ktrZetto.
[16:34:23]  chef_zack: he called you a noob LULW
[16:34:55]  kaeos: The dialogue is the best in this game!
[16:36:03]  robertzarmy: you'd probably say that
[16:36:06]  cosmicmikan: LUL
[16:36:28]  robertzarmy: you'd lose and start crying idk
[16:36:54]  robertzarmy: you are a sociopath.
