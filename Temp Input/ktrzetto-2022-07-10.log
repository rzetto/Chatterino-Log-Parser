[08:50:43]  infynoko: Too busy thinking about love letters. ICANT
[08:51:17]  yourcrazym8: The only love letter I would accept is one that has 100 dollars + attached to it
[08:51:27]  infynoko: Time to ban everyone.
[08:51:28]  kaeos: gackt is getting rolled by mugen
[08:53:07]  infynoko: Isn't MUGEN an open source fighting game engine?
[08:53:34]  kaeos: no thats what i meant
[08:54:00]  kaeos: aero what
[08:54:22]  kaeos: ohh
[08:54:35]  infynoko: Chip clip or riot.
[08:54:43]  kaeos: that's incredibly based
[08:54:52]  fujitoma: eroge
[08:54:54]  infynoko: You do if you're based.
[08:55:08]  laurabraus: 73% of visual novels are eroge
[08:55:16]  laurabraus: or 18+
[08:55:18]  laurabraus: fun fact

[08:56:57]  babsmcnh: ...
[08:57:15]  babsmcnh: i didnt even know you could die in this stage PepeLaugh
[08:57:46]  yourcrazym8: imagine going viral and having people start writing weird and cringy af fan novels on tumblr etc. and all of them include sexual content, it's so weird
[08:58:17]  babsmcnh: ye its pretty strange
[08:58:34]  babsmcnh: a lot of people are weird its unsettling how common it is
[08:59:04]  kaeos: gackt won game 5 PogChamp
[08:59:14]  babsmcnh: GO FASTER POGGERS
[08:59:27]  laurabraus: ok so after actually checking on visual novel database only 57% of all visual novels have sexual content
[08:59:36]  laurabraus: i have no idea where i got that statistic
[08:59:53]  yourcrazym8: 57% is still unsettling
[08:59:59]  kaeos: proto won 3-1 PogChamp
[09:00:16]  babsmcnh: i like you more than the database so i'm going to believe the 73% you said
[09:00:24]  fredmanftw: Zetto u awesome streamer you, i hope you've been great ktrzetSmile
[09:00:36]  laurabraus: @babsmcnh thank you

[09:01:06]  laurabraus: thanks guys my credibility is stronger than actual math
[09:01:10]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice. But if you want to help support the channel, and more importantly, help your boy get paid, feel free to click the link. Please give me your money. https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip https://www.twitch.tv/products/ktrZetto
[09:01:20]  yourcrazym8: looking at humanity today, it's likely close to 80%
[09:01:22]  babsmcnh: they kept getting shipped but they weren't attracted to eachother, fans got angry at their gfs
[09:01:25]  infynoko: I write fan fiction about Chris Pratt and Jim Carrey, sorry.
[09:01:36]  fredmanftw: happy to hear ziphHypers
[09:02:14]  yourcrazym8: @babsmcnh I swear people are always starting war over fan ships it's so goddamn stupid
[09:03:11]  babsmcnh: i thought the shit would stop at edward vs. jacob but that was just the beginning.... FeelsWeirdMan
[09:03:32]  babsmcnh: omg guys IMAGINE if zetto was a real person

[09:04:27]  infynoko: "Think of the age difference, first of all... ohhhhhhh... that's not as bad as I thought." - Zetto, 2022
[09:04:46]  babsmcnh: at least you're consistently bad?
[09:04:46]  yourcrazym8: As the saying goes: ''age is just a number and so is the number of years sitting behind bars''
[09:04:53]  kaeos: its cool how i only see red but it can still PB
[09:05:02]  babsmcnh: lmao

[09:06:58]  babsmcnh: boris johnson also called someone a "great supine protoplasmic jelly invertebrate"
[09:07:06]  infynoko: Your viewers dropped by half when you quoted Boris.
[09:07:11]  babsmcnh: LOL
[09:07:30]  yourcrazym8: I wish I could move on too.... until I see an ''art'' of some overly obese unproportionate woman with a minor engulfed in her belly fat.... Yeah the only soceity is weird
[09:08:15]  babsmcnh: it was a british insult - a sort of insult that is just so random, doesnt make sense, but still offends you 🇬🇧
[09:08:18]  kaeos: +54 gold is like the shiny trash bag meme
[09:08:53]  babsmcnh: zetto so good at game ktrzetWorse
[09:09:12]  babsmcnh: oh wait whoops i meant ktrzetCool
[09:09:14]  yourcrazym8: I am talking about people expressing their dark twisted desires online with these arts and it can even include people they ship.
[09:09:16]  babsmcnh: Kapp
[09:09:28]  babsmcnh: did you hear about the anthill dude
[09:09:32]  babsmcnh: i just heard about him
[09:09:37]  laurabraus: who
[09:09:56]  babsmcnh: there was this reddit thread asking whats your deepest darkest kink
[09:10:13]  babsmcnh: this guy said he wanted to uh do something with an anthill
[09:10:14]  yourcrazym8: @babsmcnh I don't wanna see the comment section of that thread
[09:10:29]  babsmcnh: something to do with the stinging of the ants FeelsWeirdMan
[09:10:42]  babsmcnh: but he said he kept this from his wife
[09:10:53]  babsmcnh: he wanted to SHOVE HIS DICK IN AN ANTHILL
[09:11:02]  yourcrazym8: @babsmcnh oh lord
[09:11:02]  babsmcnh: i didnt think i had to spell it out tbh
[09:11:26]  yourcrazym8: well they do DRAW their weird kinks and post them online
[09:11:28]  laurabraus: why didnt he
[09:11:38]  babsmcnh: he said he was gonna try to go on a vacation to try to but the stings and shit would be noticable for his wife
[09:12:07]  babsmcnh: @laurabraus you mean why did he even think like that when he first saw an anthill
[09:12:16]  laurabraus: he was curious
[09:12:21]  babsmcnh: imagine being an ant dude
[09:12:45]  babsmcnh: crushed by a weiner Sadge destroying your colony
[09:12:50]  babsmcnh: what a sad way to go smh
[09:12:50]  yourcrazym8: the doctors themselves need therapists after dealing with people that have these kinks
[09:13:03]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL
[09:13:36]  babsmcnh: apparently it was a real post but its honestly just something i heard about
[09:13:37]  infynoko: They draw these scenarios? Sounds like A Bug's Life 2 will be a wild ride.
[09:13:40]  kaeos: i guess this means you need to develop a kink like that
[09:13:45]  babsmcnh: im sure you'll get someone...
[09:13:53]  babsmcnh: maybe he's very charismatic???
[09:14:04]  babsmcnh: WTF
[09:14:16]  babsmcnh: how do you shit in a CHAIRRR
[09:14:40]  babsmcnh: just date someone 4Head

[09:15:36]  infynoko: Honestly, that sounds like my image of most Reddit users.
[09:15:40]  babsmcnh: id feel traumatized if i didnt wipe
[09:15:47]  babsmcnh: use bumble
[09:15:52]  kaeos: hey theres nothing wrong with tinder
[09:16:02]  babsmcnh: you're already jerking off to 2d girls
[09:16:05]  laurabraus: i gave up long ago. now ive been on tinder for 6 years
[09:16:09]  babsmcnh: its basically equivalent
[09:16:13]  laurabraus: do i hate myself. MAYBE
[09:16:20]  babsmcnh: lol
[09:16:25]  laurabraus: ive been on four dates though
[09:16:35]  babsmcnh: use bumble that app is for more serious relationships tbh
[09:16:44]  infynoko: Tinder > Bumble.
[09:16:46]  babsmcnh: from what ive been told
[09:16:53]  laurabraus: bumble isnt good in my opinion
[09:16:58]  kaeos: imagine wanting to be in a serious relationship LULW
[09:17:09]  babsmcnh: reallyyy??? i heard great things about bumble
[09:17:09]  infynoko: Bumble is inherently sexist.
[09:17:19]  infynoko: Not trolling for once.
[09:17:37]  babsmcnh: how idk why it would be
[09:17:50]  laurabraus: @babsmcnh i think it just has a smaller pool because girls have to message first
[09:17:52]  babsmcnh: i've nnever used it
[09:18:05]  infynoko: It's not terrible, but it's more exploitative than Tinder.
[09:18:09]  babsmcnh: apparently uk bumble is where its at
[09:18:17]  angusa1210: holy shit LIVE Pog
[09:18:24]  laurabraus: the girl has to start the conversation or the guy cant text her
[09:18:47]  fujitoma: 綾鷹でお茶のイメージあるんですが、お酒とかも飲んだりしますか？
[09:18:47]  babsmcnh: ahhh yeah i dont get that tbh
[09:18:49]  laurabraus: yeah i didnt like it
[09:19:01]  laurabraus: chase after ME yknow
[09:19:03]  laurabraus: LOL
[09:19:07]  babsmcnh: andrew Pog
[09:19:10]  infynoko: If the girl doesn't message within 24 hours the guy is offered the choice of paying to extend the timer in hopes of her messaging. ReallyNow
[09:19:19]  babsmcnh: LMAO
[09:19:22]  angusa1210: wtf LUL
[09:19:26]  babsmcnh: who would pay lol
[09:19:39]  yourcrazym8: ''gender equility''
[09:19:40]  laurabraus: people you dont want to date
[09:19:42]  infynoko: People must be doing it. Actually wild.
[09:19:47]  yourcrazym8: equality*
[09:19:54]  fujitoma: 去年から飲んでない…！？聖人！？
[09:20:46]  babsmcnh: i just know that a lot of girls here have moved to bumble cuz a lot of guys have messaged them cringe shit first on tinder LUL
[09:21:11]  fujitoma: ビール苦手な人多いですよね😭
[09:21:22]  angusa1210: ビールが好き
[09:21:46]  laurabraus: i dont think dating apps are that bad though BECAUSE it's just harder to meet people by chance by going out these days. like you go to work and go home. or sometimes work from home and dont go anywhere
[09:21:58]  laurabraus: @babsmcnh i just unmatch those guys though
[09:22:16]  babsmcnh: @laurabraus yeah i agree
[09:22:32]  babsmcnh: true
[09:22:38]  laurabraus: bumble still has creeps but then it's your fault somehow because YOU have to make the first move
[09:22:49]  laurabraus: same with hinge
[09:22:54]  babsmcnh: idk ive just been told that bumble is for relationships and tinder is for hookups here
[09:23:07]  angusa1210: 今ビールを飲みたい
[09:23:10]  babsmcnh: hinge is like that too?
[09:23:13]  yourcrazym8: @laurabraus I'm a perfectly fine and happy human being without dating, I think it's kinda forced upon many people due to family expectations. I don't need a dating app, I need money
[09:23:19]  fujitoma: 誕生日迎えるとお幾つになる感じで？公開してなかったらすいません！
[09:23:37]  babsmcnh: "above dating apps" PepeLaugh
[09:23:38]  kaeos: wow you guys are LONELY
[09:23:45]  angusa1210: Sadge
[09:24:11]  laurabraus: tinder can be for hookups but you just gotta ask the person you matched with what theyre looking for and theyre usually honest
[09:24:29]  infynoko: There are some really cool people on dating apps, dude.
[09:24:42]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL
[09:25:04]  babsmcnh: i hope your parents just heard you shout "I AM LONELY OKAY"
[09:25:09]  laurabraus: yeah sometimes people will write what theyre looking for in their bio
[09:25:20]  babsmcnh: thats good
[09:25:22]  laurabraus: or you can tell if theyre like "here for the weekend hmu"
[09:25:25]  yourcrazym8: dating apps is close to testing a coffin and I'd rather do the latter
[09:26:13]  laurabraus: yes
[09:26:15]  kaeos: no
[09:26:19]  angusa1210: do you ever say some seriously unhinged shit in front of your parents because they wouldnt understand the english
[09:26:47]  angusa1210: o
[09:26:50]  kaeos: EW

[09:31:20]  yourcrazym8: fun thing is I was apparently in two relationships without me knowing or even approving it. There were these girls in school who just decided to declare that they were my girlfriends and they showed up before my house. It was..... awkward to say the least
[09:31:27]  babsmcnh: that was ur timesave lmao thats prety hiliarious tbh
[09:31:46]  babsmcnh: that is crazy awkward wtf
[09:32:01]  angusa1210: anime-ass plot
[09:32:35]  babsmcnh: 1) talk to girls
[09:32:50]  kaeos: cringe
[09:32:50]  babsmcnh: 2) become someone else
[09:32:58]  babsmcnh: 3) get married to girl
[09:33:15]  babsmcnh: in the order of 2, 1, 3 :)
[09:33:37]  yourcrazym8: You ask for advice from someone who was completely oblivious to any so called ''girlfriends'' lol. I wasn't even interested in either of them
[09:34:58]  angusa1210: GIGACHAD
[09:35:50]  kaeos: common zetto L
[09:35:50]  angusa1210: monkaS
[09:35:51]  yourcrazym8: The first ''girlfriend'' got mad at me because I had apparently betrayed her by ''dating'' girlfriend number 2 who I was also unaware of. I have no idea how they came up with these stories so ridiculous lmfao
[09:36:16]  babsmcnh: crazy is a playaaa
[09:36:26]  laurabraus: a player without even trying

[09:41:26]  laurabraus: same as kaeos
[09:41:31]  babsmcnh: maybe i'll get it im a champion
[09:41:45]  yourcrazym8: @babsmcnh Nah I had to pay I think about 20 bucks
[09:41:51]  kaeos: how would we even get in the same lobby as you
[09:42:03]  kaeos: unless you meant like communal fall guys playing separate servers
[09:42:14]  laurabraus: are lobbies separated by region?
[09:42:28]  babsmcnh: @babsmcnh wtffff
[09:42:45]  kaeos: its not on steam
[09:42:59]  kaeos: Notice: At the request of the publisher, Fall Guys is no longer available for sale on Steam.
[09:43:03]  babsmcnh: bro i dont think id want to play fall guys with zetto, he'd keep winning Sadge i'd have no fun...
[09:43:13]  yourcrazym8: I also have it on steam

[09:43:44]  yourcrazym8: weird I can still update it on steam tho
[09:43:46]  laurabraus: but that means we couldnt be in the same lobby right

[09:47:35]  yourcrazym8: guess I have to uninstall fall guys from steam
[09:48:48]  yourcrazym8: so stupid, i could do an update on steam but then the game itself fails me
[09:49:02]  laurabraus: i got it but i think i dont have a high enough graphics card for it
[09:49:41]  kaeos: you should be fine, they made it work on all consoles for cross platform so it runs easy
[09:49:47]  yourcrazym8: I have a gaming pc, an omen for 2100 bucks
[09:50:09]  yourcrazym8: it's decent as of right now, planning for an upgrade though
[09:50:10]  laurabraus: i'll test it out one day but i only have an i5 core and theyre saying nvidia
[09:50:40]  laurabraus: i cant even play tomb raider 2013 on this laptop and its a miracle genshin boots up at all half the time
