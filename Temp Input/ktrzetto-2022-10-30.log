[11:14:07]  laurabraus: what an awful way to go
[11:14:35]  laurabraus: thats what happened at astroworld festival
[11:14:46]  laurabraus: i think
[11:15:03]  laurabraus: yesssss
[11:15:43]  laurabraus: it must have been so out of control that it just kept happening. like at astroworld at least some people or crew probably had higher ground
[11:16:02]  laurabraus: that is so sad
[11:22:59]  303devilfish: recovering from wisdom tooth removal was pretty miserable
[11:25:23]  laurabraus: it depends though on who you get how miserable you are though
[11:25:55]  laurabraus: i havent had them taken out and i pray i don't have to
[11:26:21]  laurabraus: usually they say it takes a week to recover i think, but i think you can talk sooner than that
[11:27:03]  laurabraus: i remember in school they used to recommend getting it done before spring break so you had that week to recover
[11:28:02]  laurabraus: for real
[11:28:13]  laurabraus: and you cant even eat anything except pudding and smoothies
[11:28:57]  laurabraus: exactly
[11:29:38]  laurabraus: i'd be grinding up turkey and potatoes and like a whole thanksgiving feast into a smoothie by the end
[11:30:17]  303devilfish: i had complications with mine so my recovery was worse than average
[11:30:29]  laurabraus: but i would recommend that you get them all taken out if you can. or maybe one side and then the other. because having to recover twice would be terrible
[11:30:41]  laurabraus: just get it over with
[11:31:35]  303devilfish: dry socket HYPERS
[11:32:32]  303devilfish: the blood clot comes loose
