[10:14:33]  robertzarmy: poor ass
[10:14:36]  haine_sense1: that's weird lol
[10:14:48]  haine_sense1: @robertzarmy what are you at?
[10:14:51]  robertzarmy: more
[10:15:11]  haine_sense1: be specific
[10:15:15]  robertzarmy: I refuse
[10:15:27]  haine_sense1: they wouldn't be scared
[10:15:40]  haine_sense1: not considering what I'd be saying
[10:15:51]  haine_sense1: ok, they might be scared of what I'm saying
[10:15:56]  robertzarmy: dude that lakitu bounce is so much faster
[10:15:57]  robertzarmy: than that
[10:16:19]  robertzarmy: no i dont
[10:18:10]  haine_sense1: I need shota vtubers
[10:18:45]  haine_sense1: yes, it would be weird lol
[10:19:16]  haine_sense1: solution!
[10:19:22]  haine_sense1: have an actual kid voicing it
[10:19:32]  haine_sense1: then it's just as weird
[10:20:37]  haine_sense1: this is true
[10:20:54]  haine_sense1: that was quite bad
[10:21:28]  haine_sense1: does this practice thing allow for practicing on non-stopped ttc?
[10:21:48]  musicelliott: Yo what‚Äôs up Z
[10:23:32]  haine_sense1: yea, the first one and the one you're supposed to get to by riding on the hand
[10:25:02]  haine_sense1: ooh, those bands are cool
[10:25:11]  haine_sense1: sometimes
[10:25:33]  haine_sense1: casual players have time
[10:25:50]  haine_sense1: it takes less time when sped up
[10:28:09]  haine_sense1: now that I think about it, I like that you thought the problem with having a kid voicing a shota vtuber was the monetisation and not that then that kid would very likely be sexualised
[10:28:18]  haine_sense1: due to them being a vtuber
[10:28:45]  haine_sense1: yea of course
[10:29:18]  haine_sense1: yea, I know
[10:29:40]  haine_sense1: we already know that you're like 80
[10:30:03]  haine_sense1: "a good age"
[10:30:17]  haine_sense1: are you suggesting that some ages are better than others?
[10:30:29]  haine_sense1: how agist of you
[10:30:40]  haine_sense1: ageist
[10:31:11]  haine_sense1: except kids who think that being an adult is cool
[10:31:41]  haine_sense1: what like... laws?
[10:32:37]  haine_sense1: kids tend to be less bound by laws due to how they're often considered unaccountable for such things
[10:33:49]  haine_sense1: nah, my weekends are catching up on work
[10:33:54]  haine_sense1: cos student
[10:35:07]  haine_sense1: well yea

[10:40:00]  haine_sense1: I will get a better degree than them
[10:40:02]  haine_sense1: lol
[10:40:15]  haine_sense1: which means I have to get a 1st
[10:40:29]  haine_sense1: a 1st class degree
[10:40:41]  haine_sense1: which is basically being in the top 30% of the uni

[10:41:36]  haine_sense1: yea, basically
[10:42:23]  haine_sense1: fortunately I'm very good at being someone no one envies because I hate my life :)
[10:43:39]  haine_sense1: I mean, in reality, I've always been a shit person until I was like 17 and noticed and tried to improve myself
[10:43:49]  haine_sense1: I mean, I've still been pretty shitty since then but eh
[10:44:19]  haine_sense1: improvement comes in stages

[10:55:01]  chisasfam: Messing up bombclip in 16 star is worse then messing it up in 70 id think
[10:55:04]  haine_sense1: WHY IS A CONE NOT A TOPOLOGICAL SURFACE??
[10:55:05]  chisasfam: they sag an average amount
[10:55:07]  robertzarmy: hmm

[10:56:34]  chisasfam: to sag or not the sag
[10:57:02]  robertzarmy: tbh zetto u couldnt rock any sag
[10:57:03]  chisasfam: sagio o sagio where art thou sagio
[10:57:09]  haine_sense1: I mean, it has to be Hausdorff... since it's a subset of R^3... and it has to have a countable basis
[10:57:23]  robertzarmy: no REREAD MY MESSAGE
[10:57:30]  haine_sense1: "couldn't"
[10:58:01]  haine_sense1: @Chisasfam sageo*
[10:58:16]  chisasfam: @Chisasfam my deepest apologies <3
[10:58:38]  haine_sense1: so clearly if it's not a topological surface, then it's got some point that doesn't have an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to R^2
[10:59:10]  chisasfam: Zetto do you engage in the gaming of Minecraft, its kind of a Unknown game tbf you might not know it
[10:59:11]  haine_sense1: how much do your balls sag?
[10:59:38]  haine_sense1: you asked us, so clearly we can ask you
[11:00:03]  haine_sense1: estimate average

[11:00:33]  haine_sense1: when it's cold, your balls are supposed to stop sagging as much to keep heat
[11:00:43]  haine_sense1: to keep them at the optimal temperature
[11:01:55]  haine_sense1: they don't like being as hot as normal body temperature - hence why they sag out
[11:02:18]  chisasfam: Normalise saggy balls
[11:02:23]  haine_sense1: you also can't climb poles
[11:03:22]  haine_sense1: you didn't do my point redeem
[11:03:48]  chisasfam: if you dont have saggy balls its kinds weird
[11:03:50]  chisasfam: like Û†ÄÄ
[11:04:02]  chisasfam: theres lenf handed and right handed, we all know being left handed is better
[11:04:25]  chisasfam: lenf sadge
[11:04:42]  haine_sense1: @Chisasfam no, being central handed is way better
[11:04:53]  haine_sense1: PROMOTION
[11:04:53]  chisasfam: @Chisasfam TRUE
[11:05:36]  chisasfam: yeah no but
[11:05:38]  chisasfam: right
[11:06:17]  chisasfam: if you are left handed you have an advantage in sports bc you always play against right handed people and right handed people never play agasint left handed people
[11:06:24]  cupcake_chi: hello crewmates
[11:06:33]  chisasfam: I use my left hand on my mouse and I use arrow keys to move lol
[11:06:45]  haine_sense1: being left handed is just super sinister though
[11:07:31]  haine_sense1: @Chisasfam this is only true up to a certain level
[11:07:37]  cupcake_chi: learn the matchup haha heehee
[11:07:59]  chisasfam: depends on the sport though haine i feel
[11:08:23]  haine_sense1: don't mind me doing latin jokes in a Japanese streamer's chat
[11:08:24]  cupcake_chi: u play on keyboard....
[11:08:35]  chisasfam: I dont play sm64 keyboard lol dw
[11:09:02]  chisasfam: so I use Right shift sprint, right control crouch , Semi Colon for inventory
[11:09:25]  chisasfam: the only issue is getting used to reaching the space button
[11:09:44]  haine_sense1: specifically sinister since sinister meant left in latin or something
[11:10:08]  haine_sense1: like dexter meant right or something
[11:11:01]  haine_sense1: I remember trying
[11:11:06]  haine_sense1: it was so painful
[11:11:14]  chisasfam: I saw the 16 star on Mobile run omfg it was so weird to watch

[11:12:55]  haine_sense1: ah, but you did learn the word etymology
[11:13:12]  haine_sense1: unlike many people who speak English as their mother tongue
[11:13:35]  haine_sense1: of course, I know what it means
[11:13:36]  chisasfam: I learnt english the same way dw , I learnt it from watching american tv shows , then I learnt it properly when we moved to england
[11:13:53]  haine_sense1: England's so much better than the US
[11:14:01]  haine_sense1: we have better jokes
[11:14:05]  haine_sense1: and humour
[11:14:08]  haine_sense1: and irony
[11:14:11]  haine_sense1: and etc.
[11:14:14]  chisasfam: it is , unless you live in liverpool its a shithole
[11:14:20]  haine_sense1: ok, fair
[11:14:54]  haine_sense1: ^you can put literally any place in the England in that sentence and it still be true
[11:15:22]  haine_sense1: being in England is better than being in the US, but being in X specific place in England is worse than being in the US

[11:32:05]  haine_sense1: Zetto, based on how much I've been talking about certain things, you know what I'm thinking right?
[11:32:32]  haine_sense1: weird
[11:32:39]  chisasfam: the vowels in portuguese and Japanese are quite similar so pronounciation should be easy?
[11:32:42]  haine_sense1: it was based on the previous message
[11:33:21]  haine_sense1: Japanese pronunciation is simple
[11:33:24]  cupcake_chi: thankful I speak Spanish
