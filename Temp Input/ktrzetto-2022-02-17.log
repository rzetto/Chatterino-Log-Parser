[11:25:55]  ktrzetto: "I use Linux as my operating system," I state proudly to the unkempt, bearded man. He swivels around in his desk chair with a devilish gleam in his eyes, ready to mansplain with extreme precision. "Actually," he says with a grin, "Linux is just the kernel. you use GNU+Linux." I don't miss a beat and reply with a smirk, "I use alpine, a distro that doesn't include the GNU coreutils, or any other GNU code. It's Linux, but it's not GNU+Linux."
[11:26:25]  robertzarmy: i dont know what those words mean

[16:09:09]  robertzarmy: this accent sucks.
[16:09:29]  ledoeh: but your adding delay to obs could be of the sample rate of your audio devices or timecode of video/audio device
[16:09:39]  ledoeh: could also be more but these are the most common ones
[16:10:00]  chef_zack: Sadge
[16:10:04]  robertzarmy: gg
[16:10:23]  robertzarmy: I hear delay goes away if you turn your bitrate to 1

[16:20:09]  robertzarmy: !mask
[16:20:09]  nightbot: Zetto wears the mask to hide his identity. It's common for old Japanese internet content creators to do this, and you can see it in some older videos like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpoR_xlslLI That's what the mask is~♪ That's what the point of the mask is. ♬
[16:20:13]  chef_zack: wouldnt tell me what his job does smh
