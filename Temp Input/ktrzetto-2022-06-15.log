[04:59:42]  infynoko: Sorry, wrong chat.
[05:00:00]  haine_sense1: Yes we were buying points: subs get more channel points the higher tier
[05:00:01]  chisasfam: ahh chat is just late nvm
[05:00:05]  infynoko: Even Mario is sleeping.
[05:00:11]  haine_sense1: therefore I should be tier 3 for the next while
[05:00:22]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice. But if you want to help support the channel, and more importantly, help your boy get paid, feel free to click the link. Please give me your money. https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip https://www.twitch.tv/products/ktrZetto
[05:00:36]  infynoko: I don't sleep.
[05:00:49]  haine_sense1: *spends £20/month on the off chance of potentially getting a $100 gain*
[05:01:00]  chisasfam: zetto this is a parasocial relationship
[05:01:03]  babsmcnh: guys does he think we're human still PepeLaugh
[05:01:22]  deohang: Literally spent all my channel points
[05:01:26]  chisasfam: I sub bc ily <3
[05:01:32]  babsmcnh: 01000101110010101000 MrDestructoid
[05:01:34]  haine_sense1: Why do you think I’d sub for any other reason?
[05:01:45]  haine_sense1: If I’m donating to you, then I donate excessive money
[05:01:56]  infynoko: !giveaway
[05:01:57]  nightbot: After we hit the sub-goal, I'm starting a giveaway to send a special ONE of you some items you want from Japan, up to $100! To enter, spend your channel points with the entry redeem. Unlimited entries!
[05:02:13]  nightbot: EHEHE Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ktrZetto

[05:02:27]  chisasfam: zetto ACME merch doesnt ship to uk if I win the giveaway can I ahve that thanks
[05:02:28]  haine_sense1: but tier 3 subbing gets 100% more points
[05:02:36]  foodcloud: ktrzetHeh
[05:02:45]  deohang: Can we trust you with our addresses tho
[05:03:20]  chisasfam: no we cant
[05:03:23]  babsmcnh: also the more you gift at the end of the month the better ur odds of getting the $100 japanese package - less people gaining points and if they're all gifted at that time they dont get points as quickly
[05:03:32]  babsmcnh: big brained moved just an fyi
[05:03:36]  babsmcnh: *move
[05:03:55]  chisasfam: theyre a vkei band
[05:04:06]  haine_sense1: It’s useful for the purpose of getting extra monetary stuff
[05:04:09]  chisasfam: not as cool as my vkei band but theyre a vkei band
[05:04:20]  babsmcnh: ktrzetHeh this is good
[05:04:32]  babsmcnh: that makes it super creepy lmao
[05:04:43]  haine_sense1: Yes I know that tier 3 gets 100% more points because I’ve done it too many times
[05:04:52]  babsmcnh: okay im gonna continue watching this anime see ya guys
[05:05:06]  infynoko: Have you capped your affiliate emote slots?
[05:05:08]  babsmcnh: also we gotta do more bets now cuz of this

[05:05:39]  chisasfam: or use a friends address ?
[05:05:55]  haine_sense1: It’ll only be one person
[05:05:56]  chef_zack: i think most people dont care
[05:06:03]  haine_sense1: And so far it’s probably gonna be @deohang
[05:06:25]  parkgimbap: First name KTR last name Zetto. then for address you just put your twitch link Kappa
[05:06:38]  infynoko: KTR = Koutarou. Zetto = Zetto. Your name is Koutarou Zetto. It's too easy. ReallyNow ICANT

[05:10:48]  chisasfam: they're still on mine
[05:10:55]  chisasfam: @DeoHang agreed
[05:11:45]  deohang: @chisasfam 🤝
[05:11:50]  haine_sense1: I need you to stream at non-eu friendly times so that I can be awake to farm channel points while they don’t ;)
[05:11:54]  infynoko: Asked Zetto on a date and got left on read. ReallySad
[05:12:10]  chisasfam: EU friendly or not ill still join
[05:12:15]  chisasfam: because I dont have college anymore
[05:12:37]  chisasfam: Hiroji Miyamoto **
[05:12:37]  haine_sense1: @infynoko Sadge
[05:12:39]  deohang: You always stream at 2 or 3 am for me deohanGshake2

[05:21:44]  chef_zack: metroid seems too soon
[05:22:00]  infynoko: Damn, you would have really liked some of the shows I've been to if you're into all these artists.
[05:22:05]  deohang: Fingers crossed for tomodachi life but I’m being too wishful with this probably
[05:22:46]  chisasfam: @Infynoko Im will do the shows my self if they dont come here
[05:23:26]  infynoko: "I'm not really good with real life."
[05:23:34]  chisasfam: zetto when I come to japan and start an empic vkei band will you come to my shows
[05:23:40]  chisasfam: whatever you say will be taken as a yes

[05:25:43]  chef_zack: there was
[05:25:46]  chef_zack: miitomo
[05:25:47]  chisasfam: and Minecraft Earth

[05:25:55]  chisasfam: yes
[05:26:05]  chisasfam: I have some now Ill send you them give me your full name and address

[05:30:45]  infynoko: My extrovertedness got almost literally beat out of me in high school, but after years it started redeveloping. Your environment contributes a lot to your level of comfort, but surrounding yourself with open-minded people helps.
[05:31:38]  haine_sense1: Ok, waiting for food so I return
[05:32:08]  chisasfam: ぜっとげってぇｂらｗｌはっぁばｔｔぇおぱｓｓ

[05:32:45]  haine_sense1: Lol
[05:33:56]  haine_sense1: Anticipate what I’m going to say in my next message
[05:34:04]  infynoko: You remind me a lot of my friend Ayu. She's a huge hiki but she's super chill and well-spoken.
[05:35:08]  chisasfam: zetto did you know Id ask you to play the lego movie game?
[05:35:19]  chisasfam: did you prepare for me to ask you to play the lego movie game
[05:35:27]  chisasfam: can you play the lego movie game
[05:35:31]  haine_sense1: [I have a message prepared for you to guess]
[05:35:41]  chisasfam: Atleast you went out!! and thats step forward yk
[05:36:56]  chisasfam: my friend from holland is here, we met on discord , we played the lego movie game and it was actually fun
[05:37:09]  haine_sense1: The prepared message: Fanta’s really nice I’ve missed it
[05:37:22]  chisasfam: fun
[05:37:29]  chisasfam: idk
[05:37:35]  chisasfam: well we have done more stuff
[05:37:56]  chisasfam: but on his first day here I was like, "Wanna play the lego movie game?"
[05:37:59]  chisasfam: and he said yes
[05:37:59]  infynoko: Josh's offline chat is popping.
[05:38:02]  chisasfam: and we played it
[05:38:07]  haine_sense1: By Fanta I was mostly referring to the red Fanta
[05:38:10]  deohang: I’ve only met 2 online friends so far
[05:38:26]  deohang: One was a jerk/incel and the other is jack
[05:38:39]  chisasfam: @DeoHang Same, but one of them was my gf at the time
[05:38:56]  infynoko: EZ Clap
[05:38:59]  infynoko: Nice gamble.
[05:39:18]  chef_zack: i think its strawberry
[05:40:04]  chisasfam: meeting people online is scary
[05:40:06]  chisasfam: yeahh
[05:40:07]  chef_zack: i think offline chat is a great way to meet people, ive talked to so many people from other cultures walks of life etc
[05:40:07]  303devilfish: this guy's skill is insane...
[05:40:15]  deohang: @chisasfam Agree
[05:40:19]  infynoko: I meet people online and then meet them IRL the same day sometimes.
[05:40:27]  infynoko: Maybe that's weirder.
[05:40:30]  haine_sense1: I’ve never met any online friends
[05:40:34]  chisasfam: the requirements to be my friend are
[05:40:37]  chisasfam: like the lego movie
[05:40:39]  haine_sense1: I probably couldve met one of them
[05:40:41]  parkgimbap: when y'all finally meet online friends irl do you still call each other by online names or by their real names?
[05:40:43]  chisasfam: and like the lego movie game

[05:51:13]  infynoko: Oh wow, you added this track after I made Josh play it? Nice.

[06:13:53]  infynoko: Yeah, you can do some ACE-type RAM manipulation.
[06:14:29]  303devilfish: beat my link to the past time
[06:14:48]  infynoko: It was orb in 2011, cloud from like 2013 or so, then RAM manip, but I had dipped by then.
[06:16:41]  haine_sense1: That’s probably why they’ve made ACE not allowed in pape

[06:25:06]  haine_sense1: I’m just gonna try to improve at a game that basically no one plays so I can submit a run to it
[06:25:42]  haine_sense1: But before I submit a run to it, I need to actually finish the game
[06:26:18]  haine_sense1: It’s a game I played a newer version of as a kid so it’s kinda nostalgic to me
[06:27:27]  haine_sense1: See discord for the game

[06:34:52]  musicelliott: It seems like some people are just more prone to get it than others. It’s hard to explain
[06:35:57]  musicelliott: I don’t wear masks much outside here unless there’s a lot of people, but I always do wear them inside places. Outside just doesn’t make sense to me
