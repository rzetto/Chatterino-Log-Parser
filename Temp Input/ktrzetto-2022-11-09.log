[11:09:08]  infynoko: Oh yeah, you entered from there.
[11:09:35]  infynoko: Yeah, it’s a fun game to learn.
[11:10:05]  infynoko: One of the only games I ever had a relatively competitive time in.
[11:10:27]  infynoko: There are capeless categories, if you’d prefer those.
[11:11:27]  infynoko: To access Star World 1 you need to enter from above and to the right of Donut Plain 1.

[11:16:10]  infynoko: Holding an item makes controlling your ascent easier.
[11:16:50]  infynoko: You just need to run right far enough to gain flight speed.
