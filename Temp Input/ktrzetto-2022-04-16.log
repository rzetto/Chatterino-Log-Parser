[09:10:38]  haine_sense1: Casual playthrough?
[09:10:51]  haine_sense1: Also heya cutie
[09:11:30]  haine_sense1: Sucking ass? That sounds fun
[09:11:36]  rickitarr64: heey
[09:11:38]  rickitarr64: he's back
[09:11:41]  rickitarr64: the man behind the mask
[09:12:15]  rickitarr64: it's the lyrics to a song by Alice Cooper haha
[09:12:30]  rickitarr64: I'm doing good thanks. Busy week at work
[09:12:55]  rickitarr64: haha. It's good in the car
[09:13:15]  andrewangus: LIVE Pog
[09:13:20]  haine_sense1: The thing is I’d also much rather prefer not to suck ass, I’m just doing what I do and living up to expectations of a gay guy who says too much :)
[09:14:54]  haine_sense1: That being said, according to a dream I had last night, I would like to have my ass played with
[09:17:15]  haine_sense1: Anyway, I should probably stop saying stuff like that
[09:18:06]  haine_sense1: You say that as if I’m not completely fine with saying all this to pretty much anyone
[09:19:10]  rickitarr64: big deal in the math world huh?
[09:19:24]  haine_sense1: Probs not gonna get anywhere in the maths world
[09:19:55]  haine_sense1: I just have interest - not really enough motivation to do anything but learn
[09:20:24]  rickitarr64: that'll serve you well in the long run
[09:21:43]  haine_sense1: How about people who aren’t willing to put in the effort to get anything beyond general intuition
[09:22:44]  haine_sense1: Honestly im kinda just thinking I’d like to just go into climbing properly
[09:23:15]  haine_sense1: I mean, not properly properly but getting more involved
[09:24:00]  haine_sense1: Possibly as a job
[09:24:15]  haine_sense1: Probably not though
[09:24:51]  haine_sense1: Idek
[09:25:00]  rinta_rnt: Cheer1 Shigoto Day
[09:25:38]  haine_sense1: I just know that to have any sort of feeling that im actually happy I have to do some climbing or athletics or something
[09:27:35]  rickitarr64: my work pretty much takes up my whole life. It has pros and cons haha
[09:27:43]  haine_sense1: I think academia is too depressing for me lol
[09:27:50]  chisasfam: Hello zepoo
[09:29:39]  haine_sense1: Anyway, what am I doing? Talking about serious things instead of being weird and making you uncomfortable???
[09:31:10]  haine_sense1: Hm… which one depresses me less? ktrzetThink
[09:33:17]  kirosthegreat: Back to SM64. Nice ktrzetYay
[09:33:52]  haine_sense1: Hm… you sound like you need a hug/other similar thing that you’re more comfortable with
[09:34:17]  cosmicmikan: hello
[09:34:30]  kirosthegreat: I slept 1 hr 44 mins last night. Though last night was more like 5am this morning ._. Insomnia is a cruel mistress.
[09:35:12]  dvsblack: finally back to a decent game
[09:35:59]  haine_sense1: Sorry, I can’t give you any more money, I’ve already given you too much
[09:36:43]  kirosthegreat: I even took some benzos around 1 but it just didn't happen LUL
[09:37:05]  rickitarr64: Cheer100
[09:37:13]  rickitarr64: because you asked for money
[09:37:17]  kirosthegreat: Obligatory moneys Cheer100
[09:37:52]  dvsblack: guys you dont need to give him money
[09:37:59]  dvsblack: he can starve a day or two
[09:38:52]  kirosthegreat: <3 Gonna go back to lurking while I finish dinner. Back later o/
[09:38:56]  usausachu: !lurk in 4K time
[09:38:56]  nightbot: bye bitch
[09:39:14]  dvsblack: look at him, hes clearly famished
[09:39:24]  haine_sense1: If I had a stable source of excessive income, then I’d give you excessive money
[09:40:29]  haine_sense1: I know I don’t have to
[09:40:38]  dvsblack: you're not fine
[09:40:52]  dvsblack: could literally make a unicef ad from clipping this stream
[09:41:16]  rickitarr64: are you back doing 70 now or 16?
[09:41:25]  dvsblack: haha
[09:42:07]  haine_sense1: When’s your first 120 run?
[09:42:35]  kaeos: Hi you are an amazing person low-key, I think you are very caring, I havent watched alot of streams but I remember one where it meant the world to me. Thanks for being a content creator.
[09:42:59]  inspectredc: sugr pog
[09:43:45]  haine_sense1: such a genuine message
[09:44:51]  haine_sense1: I wish I could rip your heart out of your body and hug it to keep it warm
[09:44:56]  rickitarr64: can we have a prediction plz?
[09:45:01]  haine_sense1: Wait… that would kill you
[09:45:04]  haine_sense1: No
[09:45:08]  haine_sense1: I wouldn’t like that
[09:45:40]  rickitarr64: @Haine_Sense1 so wrong so right haha
[09:45:58]  rickitarr64: lolllll
[09:46:10]  rickitarr64: just do one for cannonless or something
[09:47:03]  kaeos: would you consider yourself a gamer?
[09:47:20]  haine_sense1: FUCK YOU ZETTO YOU MADE ME LOSE ALL MY POINTS BY MAKING ME USE MY POINTS :( :( :( :(
[09:47:22]  rickitarr64: yeah exactly haha
[09:47:54]  chisasfam: HELLO ZETTO IM BACVK <3
[09:47:57]  chisasfam: Gl on runs
[09:48:07]  kaeos: prove it
[09:48:10]  kaeos: say some slurs right now
[09:48:35]  chisasfam: the ch one?
[09:48:43]  chisasfam: its used for asian people
[09:48:52]  chisasfam: thats the only one you can reclaim I think
[09:49:02]  saltychildofthesea: i swear every fucking time i come here you say something crazier
[09:49:03]  kaeos: bagel?
[09:49:08]  cosmicmikan: LOL
[09:49:21]  chisasfam: Yes I can talk about bread
[09:49:26]  cosmicmikan: i dont think anyone should say slurs period
[09:49:29]  cosmicmikan: no need for them
[09:49:43]  haine_sense1: I’m so confused what word you were talking about
[09:49:52]  kaeos: just say them all
[09:49:53]  chisasfam: And yeah if you are part of that race / community you can use those words, not that you should
[09:49:58]  haine_sense1: Obviously I knew the n one, but idk the others
[09:50:05]  kaeos: if ur discriminating equally theres no issue
[09:50:15]  chisasfam: toast?
[09:50:20]  chisasfam: are you talking about toast?
[09:51:25]  kaeos: 🍘
[09:51:26]  cosmicmikan: i wouldnt risk it
[09:52:01]  kaeos: toast is literally crunchy
[09:52:11]  chisasfam: Ive watched POC streamers say the N word and LGBTQ streamers use the f slur and nothing happened I think it depends on if you are apart of that community / race
[09:52:27]  haine_sense1: I mean like, all people on earth are fucking horrible people so discriminate against everyone
[09:52:30]  kaeos: they are salty if you put salted butter on them
[09:52:41]  saltychildofthesea: salt biscuit
[09:52:57]  kaeos: say some slurs about "british" "people"

[09:53:11]  haine_sense1: Lol, that would be funny
[09:53:11]  saltychildofthesea: 3Head wtF
[09:53:13]  chisasfam: Idk Slurs are bad idk why you would use them like even to reclaim, Idk Im not really part of any communities able to "reclaim slurs" so I dont think I can talk about reclaiming them
[09:53:43]  chisasfam: I cant even reclaim slurs for Hispanics / latinos bc Im white , even though im south american :p
[09:54:03]  rickitarr64: hhahaha
[09:54:06]  rickitarr64: limey
[09:54:18]  haine_sense1: They’d all just make me laugh if there are lol
[09:54:36]  saltychildofthesea: slurs are pretty bad
[09:54:50]  cosmicmikan: yes
[09:55:06]  saltychildofthesea: its not fun being called a slur
[09:55:19]  haine_sense1: One of the things I don’t understand is humanity
[09:55:20]  cosmicmikan: its really not
[09:56:36]  haine_sense1: Ok, society
[09:56:37]  saltychildofthesea: humans are really confusing
[09:56:48]  chisasfam: Its okay the concept of humanity can be confusing
[09:56:54]  haine_sense1: I mean, also humans but like, yea
[09:57:26]  haine_sense1: Nah, society exists because people don’t like being lonely
[09:58:02]  saltychildofthesea: explaining society using YEP COCK pics
[09:58:19]  cosmicmikan: LULW
[09:58:42]  haine_sense1: Hey Zetto, I sent a picture of your cock to you in your dms. Can you verify that it is indeed yours? [the above is not serious or true]
