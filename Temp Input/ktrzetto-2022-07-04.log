[05:54:39] ktrZetto is live!
[05:55:51]  streamelements: ktrZetto is now live! Streaming Super Mario 64: JP/EN i called in sick today
[05:58:17]  babsmcnh: Putting you on in the background but GL with ur runs today zetto HYPERS
[05:58:21]  kirosthegreat: Clicked everywhere but 'here' and then typed your url. Because I'm a rebel and can't be controlled.
[06:00:16]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice. But if you want to help support the channel, and more importantly, help your boy get paid, feel free to click the link. Please give me your money. https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip https://www.twitch.tv/products/ktrZetto
[06:03:27]  kirosthegreat: usausaUSA  Just a little hard to hear you above music. I'd lower bgm a couple notches
[06:03:55]  kirosthegreat: usausaNodders sounds good
[06:06:11]  kirosthegreat: The red coins star is really unforgiving if you aren't -PERFECT- with your movements
[06:07:32]  deohang: Omg eu friendly
[06:08:15]  usausachu: Here
[06:08:21]  kirosthegreat: There
[06:08:54]  deohang: My internet did not work for the past two days lmao so I didn‚Äôt stream
[06:09:09]  deohang: Also it was a wig
[06:09:33]  deohang: Got it for when I can‚Äôt be bothered with doing my hair for stream
[06:11:00]  deohang: If you put dry shampoo in your hair the night before it‚Äôll give you some volume
[06:12:35]  kirosthegreat: Everyone has hair wax. Just sweat a lot style as you like Jebaited
[06:13:10]  deohang: Dry shampoo is such a lifesaver for me when I‚Äôm traveling
[06:15:05]  deohang: You could buy a small container and refill that with the hair wax
[06:15:56]  kirosthegreat: Think it's like 2 or 3 oz containers are the max amount of liquids you can travel with if it's not a factory sealed thing like a can of coke. Though I haven't seen people take cans of coke with them so maybe that's no longer allowed either orooShrug
[06:18:41]  kirosthegreat: Nah, those cans are strong af. They're sealed at a couple atmospheres worth of pressure to provide rigidity for stacking and shit. But they can withstand a few times ther normal pressure to account for heat.
[06:19:18]  kirosthegreat: Never traveled long enough to do laundry
[06:20:58]  kirosthegreat: Oh yeah, I think I saw that video a while back. Whoever came up with the can design was low key genius
[06:22:00]  angusa1210: holy shit LIVE Pog

[06:31:53]  kaeos: why would you READ hentai LULW
[06:32:01]  kirosthegreat: For the plot Kappa
[06:32:10]  kaeos: imagine all these years of technology and you decide to LOWER the amount of frames

[06:37:37]  laurabraus: but thats a legitimate reason
[06:37:43]  kaeos: fuck ur mental health
[06:37:58]  kaeos: 9-9 7 days a week is the grind
[06:38:41]  laurabraus: same
[06:38:55]  kaeos: no life
[06:38:59]  kaeos: everything is for big corpo
[06:41:07]  kaeos: npc
[06:41:21]  laurabraus: i hate when that happens
[06:41:32]  kaeos: cutting weeds for 14 hours
[06:41:52]  laurabraus: you said 6 actually
[06:41:58]  kaeos: do u take growth hormones
[06:42:38]  laurabraus: no i think he means like for. your. you know
[06:42:50]  laurabraus: i get spam emails about that
[06:42:53]  laurabraus: LOL
[06:42:58]  kaeos: i was gonna make a joke about his hair but u made it weird
[06:43:46]  kirosthegreat: Yeah, hgh just gives you a little bit of energy when you're an adult. Not much else.
[06:44:06]  laurabraus: dude ive been getting spam emails like 5 times a DAY i just delete 200 messages every month
[06:44:11]  kirosthegreat: Human growth hormone
[06:44:49]  laurabraus: yeah i do too but it doesnt delete automatically and i saw the time stamps last time i went to bulk delete
[06:45:01]  kaeos: !lurk
[06:45:01]  nightbot: bye bitch
[06:46:41]  laurabraus: yeah its not crypto but i get those "YOURE OUR WINNER FOR A BAZILLION DOLLARS" ones
[06:47:32]  laurabraus: you're our millionth customer! this is not a joke!
[06:48:22]  laurabraus: yeah you'd have to prepare for it
[06:48:33]  laurabraus: like get a fake everything
[06:49:05]  laurabraus: well wouldnt it just be $10. yeah
[06:49:13]  laurabraus: or it could be an easy loss of $100
[06:49:30]  kirosthegreat: They'd probably just keep the 100 bucks
[06:49:41]  laurabraus: yeah i agree
[06:49:48]  laurabraus: but what if they didn't
[06:50:29]  laurabraus: they have
[06:50:42]  laurabraus: i've seen people scamming scammers before
[06:51:43]  laurabraus: it's usually hackers that hack into the scammer's computer and they can see everything they're doing so they have the one-up on them it's crazy
[06:52:21]  laurabraus: oh is it a specific person?
[06:52:27]  laurabraus: i just remember seeing it a long time ago
[06:53:04]  laurabraus: yesss that too
[06:53:31]  kirosthegreat: A few people try it. Whether they're successful or not is questionable. Browning always has evidence of his hacks through CCTV feeds.
[06:57:24]  kirosthegreat: I've seen some claim that they've shutdown 40+ computers on a network, but their only evidence is their own command prompt saying that x number of PCs were locked and someone on the phone sounding nervous. But you can mimic that with a batch script, so idk
[06:58:54]  kirosthegreat: Aye, that's what I was thinking
[06:59:10]  kirosthegreat: Gonna lurk for a bit and rest wrist. gl mate
[07:00:14]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice.

[07:09:19]  chisasfam: he also left his game on, its using up electricity , you should tell him that too
[07:09:48]  chisasfam: we need to be eco friendly in these trying time and leaving your PC on when you go is not the way to go
[07:09:50]  laurabraus: he could be using that electricity for air conditioning
[07:09:58]  chisasfam: exactly! or lighting!
[07:10:03]  rinta_rnt: 2„Å†„ÇàÂêà„Çè„Åõ„Å¶
[07:10:58]  chisasfam: thats 2 minutes of electricity gone
[07:10:59]  chisasfam: wasted
[07:11:03]  chisasfam: gone forever
[07:11:20]  chisasfam: well yeah I was about to say
[07:11:28]  chisasfam: it was converted into something not as good
[07:11:29]  chisasfam: like sound
[07:11:31]  rinta_rnt: MINING WITH 1000W PS
[07:11:31]  chisasfam: light
[07:11:32]  chisasfam: heat
[07:11:45]  laurabraus: i failed physics four quarters in a row
[07:11:49]  chisasfam: mostly sound and heat
[07:12:02]  chisasfam: Yeah exactly
[07:12:24]  laurabraus: you dont have to brag :(
[07:12:25]  laurabraus: LMAO
[07:12:32]  laurabraus: im kidding
[07:12:42]  chisasfam: that electricity could've been used to power someone's lights
[07:12:48]  chisasfam: I failed physics too laura its okay
[07:12:54]  chisasfam: I feel like we have spoken about that
[07:13:00]  laurabraus: we did
[07:13:05]  chisasfam: yes yes
[07:13:06]  laurabraus: because you sent a chemistry problem
[07:13:14]  chisasfam: Yeah yeah, bleach
[07:13:18]  laurabraus: yeah
[07:13:33]  chisasfam: Zetto, I recently financed a really good pc from Cyberpower , you could try that!
[07:13:38]  chisasfam: Oh bc im bad at maths
[07:14:02]  laurabraus: because i was anemic and every day i would go home and pass out for 13 hours and couldnt do my homework
[07:14:08]  laurabraus: thats the REAL reason
[07:14:09]  chisasfam: at GCSE i was predicted a 8/9 (A*) and I came out with a 3 (D)
[07:14:27]  chisasfam: that was for maths and physics
[07:14:41]  laurabraus: YIKES
[07:14:50]  chisasfam: ooooh you should make it lego movie themed
[07:15:05]  chisasfam: Zetto I got really good in chemistry and Biology so you can be proud of me there
[07:15:07]  laurabraus: i didn't know it at the time, i found out at the end of the year
[07:15:18]  laurabraus: my school really was like that though
[07:15:46]  laurabraus: my teachers where i was failing were accommodating though they had me stay after and i improved
[07:16:04]  chisasfam: a 8 / 9 is an A* like highest grade you can get , a 3 is a D , a fail
[07:17:41]  laurabraus: so technically in physics, i didn't fail, I got a D every quarter. so i passed. and they didn't change it
[07:17:46]  chisasfam: zetto I have good grades I just failed the important subjects
[07:18:05]  efrye684: gl :3
[07:18:09]  chisasfam: @laurabraus a D for us is a Fail
[07:18:13]  laurabraus: wtf
[07:18:20]  chisasfam: but Im glad you didnt fail!
[07:18:26]  laurabraus: thanks me TOO
[07:18:52]  chisasfam: Zetto be proud of me I went to work and I got a 1 GBP tip
[07:19:00]  chisasfam: my keyboard doesnt have a pounds symbol
[07:19:14]  laurabraus: nope it just reflects badly on your grade point average. i didn't have to retake it
[07:19:30]  chisasfam: Great British Pounds
[07:19:35]  chisasfam: I dont have a pounds button
[07:19:48]  laurabraus: how much is that in dollars
[07:20:01]  chisasfam: like $1.50?
[07:20:08]  chisasfam: oh wait ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£
[07:20:09]  laurabraus: no no this was in high school. instead of three terms we have four
[07:20:14]  chisasfam: Turns out i do, its in a weird place
[07:20:21]  laurabraus: so we took physics all year and you get a grade for every quarter
[07:20:40]  laurabraus: so i didn't have to repeat the year. i just did poorly in science that year basically
[07:20:59]  laurabraus: yeah
[07:21:04]  chisasfam: thats weird , we did a class a whole year and got 1 grade at the end
[07:21:04]  laurabraus: i didn't mean to LMAO
[07:21:23]  laurabraus: YEAH I DID PASS I GUESS
[07:21:32]  laurabraus: @Chisasfam WTF
[07:21:48]  chisasfam: yeah its kinda similar to what zetto had
[07:22:03]  laurabraus: dude we got quarter grades, midterm grades, and final grades. there were like 6 columns on our report card
[07:22:18]  chisasfam: every term we would get a paper with what they think we will get at the end of the course then what grade level were working at now
[07:22:25]  laurabraus: i agree
[07:22:33]  chisasfam: america seems stressful
[07:22:50]  laurabraus: INDEED
[07:23:23]  laurabraus: sometimes it's by school
[07:23:29]  laurabraus: in college it's by class sometimes LMAO
[07:23:41]  chisasfam: I have business cards of my band, and today there is a Festival in Manchester so I saw loads of artists and music Promoters and the fesitval organisers , so I gave them my bands business card
[07:23:57]  chisasfam: after talking with some of them they asked how long my band had been preaching gospel
[07:23:58]  laurabraus: you're talking about the country that made up a new measurement system just to be quirky
[07:24:05]  chisasfam: thats when i found out it was a christian music festival
[07:24:28]  laurabraus: LMAOOOOO
[07:24:30]  laurabraus: no way.....
[07:24:31]  chisasfam: @laurabraus thats very y2k of ameirca
[07:24:53]  laurabraus: okay but skillet slaps. they're christian
[07:25:26]  chisasfam: true! my band however is not so we dont fit in B)
[07:25:40]  laurabraus: swipe those business cards back
[07:25:46]  chisasfam: It was too late

[07:26:59]  chisasfam: im sure
[07:27:07]  chisasfam: "I hate religion" puts you on a few
[07:27:11]  chisasfam: yes
[07:27:16]  chisasfam: you can spread your dislike
[07:27:29]  laurabraus: i think "religion" is too broad to get hated on for
[07:28:06]  laurabraus: mario is your religion
[07:28:31]  chisasfam: for me , The concept of a big over seeing eye who like judges and send you to eternal suffering for not aligning with its "plan" its kinda weird, almost north korea type beat
[07:28:49]  laurabraus: princess peach's castle DOES kind of look like a cathedral
[07:29:25]  laurabraus: dude what if thats why bowser's levels are all below it.....you're in hell...
[07:29:30]  chisasfam: yeah its fine to believe in it, just just not my thing personally, its stressful
[07:29:36]  chisasfam: TRUE

[10:26:56]  babsmcnh: inject
[10:27:08]  chisasfam: p sure you can smoke heroine too
[10:27:23]  chisasfam: i think so?
[10:27:52]  johnny3oak: unsolved Sadge
[10:28:12]  babsmcnh: i think some drugs can be ingested in multiple ways
[10:28:16]  chisasfam: Im not a drug user so I dont take what I say for fact, its just my guess and knowledge from my friends
[10:28:20]  jintae_: this is the run ktr
[10:28:22]  jintae_: this the run
[10:28:32]  babsmcnh: but yeah ketamine must be administered intravenously
[10:28:35]  babsmcnh: Prayge
[10:28:39]  chisasfam: @babsmcnh yeah you can eat and smoke weed uhhhh
[10:28:59]  babsmcnh: yeah smoking it just makes you get high quicker
[10:29:18]  laurabraus: i thought eating it made you get high quicker
[10:29:20]  babsmcnh: one time i convinced another chem eng person that i had injected alcohol
[10:29:34]  chisasfam: we made alcohol in chem class
[10:29:37]  chisasfam: like
[10:29:44]  chisasfam: not drinkable
[10:29:55]  chisasfam: just the chemical bc we were learning about making alcohols
[10:29:56]  babsmcnh: i think they thought you inject weed and i was like "yea i inject alcohol in my veins to get the hit faster" in a sarcastic way
[10:30:00]  babsmcnh: she believed me
[10:30:51]  chisasfam: @babsmcnh that reminds me of some normie saying Brasil is in spain and my dad saying Japan is controlled by china , its the kinda things that Facebook users think
[10:30:55]  babsmcnh: @laurabraus which ever takes longer to process in the body is worse
[10:31:15]  babsmcnh: i mean people have believed that i swam from bermuda to canada before

[10:31:47]  chisasfam: To be fair
[10:31:55]  babsmcnh: thats all i remember from biochem EZ
[10:32:06]  johnny3oak: some people drink alcohol through their ass for that purpose
[10:32:12]  johnny3oak: so that it doesnt filter and you get drunk faster
[10:32:12]  babsmcnh: yeah
[10:32:21]  chisasfam: the hightst alcohol % you can buy is 96% and its labeled as a "risk to life" as it can literally kill you in a shot bc the % is that high
