[12:17:53]  kaeos: it's too bad real life isn't an anime, otherwise Japan's prayers would have awoken their innate potential and won the world cup
[12:18:26]  303devilfish: they just needed to scream more and say something about friendship
[12:19:23]  kaeos: is he based on Yuta Watanabe
[12:19:24]  roboplodicus: hey dude
[12:20:02]  kaeos: he's like the only Japanese player in the NBA
[12:20:12]  kaeos: at least that I can think of off the top of my head
[12:20:22]  kaeos: oh yeah I forgot
[12:21:03]  roboplodicus: yuta is 6'8"
[12:21:10]  kaeos: messi is 5'7" and he's the goat
[12:21:49]  kaeos: ohtani is the goat üêê
[12:22:21]  roboplodicus: basketball is total shenanigans your right though you absolutely have to be tall
[12:22:50]  kaeos: I mean Allen Iverson was 5'9"
[12:23:11]  kaeos: or someone else
[12:23:21]  roboplodicus: @kaeos you have any idea how many current nba players are under 6"
[12:23:23]  roboplodicus: 6'
[12:23:35]  kaeos: oh I was thinking of Isaiah Thomas
[12:23:40]  roboplodicus: the whole world except the USA and Japan loves soccer more than any other sport
[12:23:47]  303devilfish: KAM ON INGERLAND Pepega ü•Å
[12:24:06]  roboplodicus: whats the biggest sport in japan is it baseball?
[12:24:24]  kaeos: what about India and cricket
[12:25:05]  kaeos: or aus and rugby
[12:25:07]  roboplodicus: @kaeos I'm not sure that was the other sport I thought might be most popular also maybe in the formerly british carribeanj
[12:25:33]  roboplodicus: @kaeos thats actually true "australian rules football" is pretty popular
[12:25:46]  roboplodicus: soccer is the favorite sport of like 95% of the world though
[12:25:55]  kaeos: China and ping pong
[12:26:05]  kaeos: Russia and Russian roulette
[12:26:24]  roboplodicus: apparently in China Basketball is the biggest sport I just looked it up
[12:27:04]  roboplodicus: cricket is biggest in india too just did another fact check
[12:27:21]  kaeos: "my team"
[12:27:25]  kaeos: "we lost"
[12:27:51]  roboplodicus: the worst are the people that get in a bad mood when their team loses I had a roommate like that
[12:28:16]  roboplodicus: is boogie board big in japan near you or in general?
[12:28:30]  roboplodicus: boogie boarding*
[12:28:59]  kaeos: if your countries favorite sport then I know ur GDP is less than 4 trillion
[12:29:04]  kaeos: is soccer
[12:29:29]  roboplodicus: @kaeos germany is the exception
[12:29:51]  roboplodicus: its the foam board you lie down on to ride waves
[12:30:20]  kaeos: I've never heard of boogie boarding
[12:30:34]  kaeos: is that foam board like the one you held when you were learning to swim
[12:30:38]  roboplodicus: I watch boogie boarding and there are always like 5 japanese women in the tournaments
[12:30:46]  roboplodicus: @kaeos no thats a paddleboard
[12:31:10]  roboplodicus: a boogie board will be about 3 and half feet long like 70% of your height
[12:31:28]  kaeos: is being flat chested advantageous because you resist the water less
[12:31:59]  roboplodicus: @kaeos your chest is on the board above the water boobs wouldnt be dragging
[12:32:45]  roboplodicus: look up "boogie boarding" its also called "bodyboarding" in tournaments more often but most people that aren't that into the sport call it boogie boarding
[12:34:15]  roboplodicus: its sick though its pretty similar to stand up surfing but you do more aerial moves while surfing you do more moves moving around the wave
[12:35:20]  kaeos: watch basketball
[12:35:38]  kaeos: :/
[12:35:38]  roboplodicus: did you watch space jam?
[12:36:31]  kaeos: if space jam 2 were good I genuinely think more people would think lebron is the goat over Jordan
[12:36:41]  roboplodicus: there is one space jam from the 90s and another from 2015 or something the one from the 90s is where the looney toons team up wth michael jordan to  play basketball against mean cartoon aliens
[12:37:11]  roboplodicus: lebron james may be better at basketball but in the 90s jordan was considered a minor deity/god
[12:37:11]  kaeos: space jam 2 was bad for his legacy
