[10:50:05]  chef_zack: that shit was aids

[10:50:46]  chisasfam: Zetto if I paid you could you provide a small translation service for me :))
[10:50:46]  chef_zack: yeah
[10:50:57]  chef_zack: or be lucky that you arent born with them
[10:51:45]  chisasfam: Yay , It would be like less than 30 seconds
[10:51:54]  chisasfam: I‚Äôll message you about it later
[10:52:07]  chef_zack: an album
[10:52:24]  chef_zack: the lyrics were unrecognizable
[10:52:53]  chisasfam: That seems very tedious lmfao
[10:53:55]  chisasfam: Mines just like a post music video message like ‚Äúthanks for watching ect‚Äù and it would be subtitled with me talking English and there would be Portuguese and Japanese subtitles
[10:55:13]  chisasfam: It‚Äôs like when artists release instrumentals for their songs then the one good song like their best song they have, no instrumental
[10:56:02]  chisasfam: Neither do I , but as a singer it‚Äôs good to practice too
[10:56:24]  chisasfam: I think it‚Äôs so people can cover them easier / use them for samples
[10:57:12]  andrewangus: „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ
[10:57:19]  musicelliott: One cool thing about instrumental music is you can create your own story in your mind based on what you hear premierYuck
[10:58:03]  chisasfam: No, Hiroji Miyamoto has instrumentals of all of his songs in his releases
[10:58:08]  chisasfam: As an example ^
[10:59:38]  chisasfam: Zetto why is „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ wrote with „ÅØ and not „Çè
[10:59:48]  chisasfam: When it‚Äôs pronounced with wa
[10:59:53]  chisasfam: Unless I‚Äôm deaf
[11:00:19]  andrewangus: holy shit i understand
[11:00:24]  andrewangus: that makes so much sense
[11:01:31]  chisasfam: Ah so they just put „ÅØ to shorten it?
[11:01:38]  chisasfam: I see okay
[11:01:46]  chisasfam: Japan lore
[11:02:24]  chisasfam: Zetto we‚Äôre you alive during the 1800s , more specifically the edo period
[11:02:28]  chisasfam: I don‚Äôt know what wa means
[11:03:18]  chisasfam: I think desu ka means ‚Äúare you‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure tho , just gathering that from o genki desu ka
[11:03:21]  chisasfam: Ah so wa is is
[11:03:31]  chisasfam: So wa , will always mean is ?
[11:04:08]  andrewangus: i think „Åß„Åô is is
[11:04:15]  andrewangus: where wa just indicated the subject
[11:04:25]  chisasfam: Well I asked if you were alive during the edo period bc you never disclosed how old you were so you know LMFAO
[11:04:36]  chisasfam: This is so confusing my brain is exploding
[11:04:57]  chisasfam: So everything is context
[11:05:07]  chisasfam: So it depends on the sentence ?
[11:07:11]  real_prime_subscription: never here in time for the prediciton Sadge
[11:07:19]  chisasfam: Yes , how do I know how old you are ?
[11:07:27]  chisasfam: Okay so higher or lower than 200v
[11:07:43]  chisasfam: are we talking 320 420 or 120 or just 20
[11:08:12]  chisasfam: I just meant 200 the v was accident
[11:09:10]  chisasfam: Okay so that narrows it down to around 10 numbers , so you weren‚Äôt alive during edo , okay
[11:09:46]  chisasfam: I won‚Äôt guess your age , I will wait for you to play the Lego movie game
[11:10:37]  chisasfam: You spent 18 hours doing a puzzle but you won‚Äôt make Lego
[11:10:39]  chisasfam: Okay

[13:16:25]  laurabraus: why do they call it BEYOND meat
[13:16:25]  chef_zack: and they're pretty good
[13:16:51]  darkphoeen1x: just a short break
[13:16:57]  chef_zack: probably cause beyond implies future and the future probably isnt animal based food

[13:38:36]  laurabraus: i would
[13:38:51]  laurabraus: thats why i should study psych and you should study math. different strengths
[13:39:01]  haine_sense1: Basically it‚Äôs just abstracted geometry where lengths don‚Äôt exist but a notion of closeness does exist
[13:39:53]  haine_sense1: What? did you say about programming?
[13:40:02]  haine_sense1: Random extra question mark

[13:44:12]  haine_sense1: I‚Äôm presuming you calculated pi by finding an upper and lower bound with the perimeter of a polygon
[13:44:26]  haine_sense1: since that‚Äôs a normal method
[13:44:34]  laurabraus: no i can guarantee i have never calculated pi ever
