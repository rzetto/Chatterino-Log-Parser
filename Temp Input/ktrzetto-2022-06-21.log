[05:24:46]  robertzarmy: stalkers are so scary dude
[05:24:46]  kaeos: ACOLA
[05:24:55]  robertzarmy: I would hate to be a girl on the interwebs
[05:25:07]  deohang: It‚Äôs so scary
[05:25:15]  kaeos: i would like to go out via thick thighs

[05:26:21]  kirosthegreat: You mean your name isn't ktrZetto? D:  My immersion
[05:26:47]  kaeos: i hope they were joking about that
[05:26:58]  kaeos: i lost respect for light if he was real about that
[05:27:37]  robertzarmy: at least if you're a vtuber people are more focused on the model than you
[05:27:48]  kirosthegreat: Well, there's also the benefit of being a cute af anime waifu. I imagine that's a major factor  Kappa
[05:28:26]  haine_sense1: hoi
[05:28:39]  robertzarmy: oh god
[05:29:29]  303devilfish: i can :)
[05:29:31]  kaeos: trash talking a 15 yr old and getting folded 20 minutes later
[05:29:35]  kaeos: that was so good to see
[05:29:50]  haine_sense1: who we talking about?
[05:29:59]  kaeos: barack obama
[05:30:40]  303devilfish: nyannAyaya Clap
[05:31:53]  kaeos: is the music kinda loud for anyone else
[05:31:54]  kirosthegreat: usausaWiggle  vs  saphiaSip
[05:32:09]  robertzarmy: ktrzetCool
[05:33:06]  303devilfish: minecraft steve POGGERS
[05:33:29]  robertzarmy: is the music kinda quiet for anyone else?
[05:33:45]  haine_sense1: no
[05:33:52]  303devilfish: üîá
[05:33:54]  haine_sense1: it was a little loud before
[05:33:58]  robertzarmy: im muted i cant hear anything
[05:34:14]  kaeos: @Haine_Sense1 british hearing LULW
[05:34:41]  robertzarmy: @Haine_Sense1 bloody hell! hearins a little bad innit?
[05:35:01]  kirosthegreat: orooShrug  I know Saph used to be a cam streamer but went basically anonymous and became a vtuber. Think Usa didn't do any cam streaming before tho, but I could be forgetting something
[05:35:22]  haine_sense1: oh fuck off twitch, stop being shit and making my entire video fair
[05:35:24]  haine_sense1: fail*
[05:35:49]  kaeos: you should switch to youtube gaming, i hear their video player is better
[05:35:51]  robertzarmy: why don't you do that
[05:36:12]  kaeos: i saw her first stream back
[05:36:19]  kaeos: i clicked on the stream and the first thing i saw was full cam on boobs with jello physics LMAO
[05:36:25]  kirosthegreat: Investment worth it usausaNodders
[05:36:52]  303devilfish: switch to facebook gaming
[05:37:24]  robertzarmy: the twitch player is - *buffers*
[05:37:27]  kirosthegreat: The only thing I like better about the player here is the low latency feature. That's literally the only benefit vs the competition
[05:37:29]  303devilfish: Twitch is too busy trying to circumvent adblockers to improve their shit
[05:37:49]  kaeos: i have like 5 adblockers for twitch so one of them will always work
[05:38:51]  robertzarmy: low latency is a myth
[05:39:07]  kirosthegreat: YES
[05:39:14]  kirosthegreat: That's infuriating
[05:39:40]  kaeos: i hate when i have to clip to see something that happened 20 seconds ago because it actually publishes it even though i dont click publish
[05:39:46]  haine_sense1: that is definitely the worst part of the player
[05:41:23]  haine_sense1: how to avoid ads: sub to everyone
[05:41:23]  robertzarmy: my adblocker works, it just makes the stream quality go super low while blocking the ads
[05:41:32]  kaeos: BatChest
[05:41:32]  kirosthegreat: LUL
[05:41:35]  303devilfish: NFTs BatChest
[05:42:41]  kirosthegreat: Oh yeah, I have the 480p one too
[05:43:01] robertzarmy redeemed Sound Alert: say hello! 100
[05:43:11]  kirosthegreat: Mine works really well but I only use firefox
[05:43:23]  robertzarmy: FIREFOX SUPERIORITY
[05:43:33]  kaeos: i use firefox
[05:43:35]  haine_sense1: I saw someone earlier streaming under the title "22.5mins of ads per hour"
[05:43:36]  kirosthegreat: usausaNodders
[05:43:42]  303devilfish: usausaNodders
[05:44:03]  robertzarmy: using chrome is the equivalent of being an apple user
[05:44:05]  kaeos: firefox feels so much nicer than chrome imo
[05:44:16]  303devilfish: I like chrome, but if you leave it up for too long it'll somehow be using like 6gb of RAM
[05:44:44]  robertzarmy: so you jailbroke your apple phone
[05:44:45]  robertzarmy: real cool
[05:45:18]  haine_sense1: I don't know if it was true or not, but they like memes a lot so it could've just been flaming twitch's latest ad campaign
[05:45:45]  kaeos: my friend is such a weeb that instead of accepting a high paying software dev job in america, he's going to japan for peanuts
[05:46:17]  robertzarmy: moving to japan to work is actual dumb idiot behavior
[05:46:20]  robertzarmy: who would want to work in japan
[05:46:48]  kirosthegreat: Firefox became the standards-oriented browser around version 1.5 well over a decade ago, and then started focusing on privacy related features, which led to actual ad blocking extensions. for a long while, chrome blockers could only fake block ads by hiding them after they already downloaded & ran. It's better now but there are still weird extension API restrictions, making different results for the same kind of extensions

[05:47:58]  kaeos: he probably wants a waifu gf
[05:48:21]  robertzarmy: anime gf BatChest
[05:49:21]  kaeos: i could not live in japan
[05:49:26]  kaeos: the food disgusts me
[05:49:31]  kaeos: and the work culture
[05:49:31]  robertzarmy: you a fish hater?
[05:49:43]  kaeos: i dont really like rice and seafood
[05:49:49]  robertzarmy: major L
[05:49:57]  kaeos: colonel L
[05:50:13]  303devilfish: Natto FeelsWeirdMan
[05:50:31]  robertzarmy: I do not vibe with takoyaki tho I will say
[05:50:36]  haine_sense1: I don't really like food in general, therefore I don't like Japanese food
[05:50:50]  kaeos: imagine enjoying sustenance LULW
[05:51:09]  kirosthegreat: Feet paste Sadge
[05:51:36]  haine_sense1: oh my video died again
[05:51:39]  haine_sense1: fuck twitch
[05:51:45]  kaeos: D:
[05:51:45]  nightbot: D:
[05:52:03]  robertzarmy: sushi as a whole is like top 3 foods tho
[05:52:24]  kaeos: i literally puked the one time i tried sushi LULW
[05:52:40]  haine_sense1: ok, ok, I like pizza
[05:52:41]  robertzarmy: what the hell
[05:53:14]  kaeos: @Haine_Sense1 pizza top 3 food
[05:53:25]  robertzarmy: what sushi did you try
[05:53:32]  kaeos: idk
[05:53:39]  kaeos: it was some americanized roll though
[05:53:42]  kirosthegreat: Honarary non-Japanese usausaNodders
[05:53:42]  robertzarmy: YUCK!
[05:53:42]  kaeos: so maybe not super fair
[05:53:54]  robertzarmy: americanized sushi is gross
[05:54:04]  robertzarmy: get mayo out of my sushi
[05:54:30]  robertzarmy: and cream cheese
[05:54:37]  robertzarmy: vile
[05:55:10]  haine_sense1: I can imagine raw salmon with cream cheese being nice
[05:55:13]  robertzarmy: I like spicy mayo on sushi tho
[05:55:13]  haine_sense1: somehow
[05:55:33]  kaeos: im pretty sure people eat salmon and cream cheese on bagels
[05:55:44]  robertzarmy: its just like a drizzle on top of sushi
[05:55:58]  kirosthegreat: Cream cheese, globs of mayo, and chunks of avocado are about the only thing I don't like in sushi, but they're somehow in damn near all our sushi yuniiSad
[05:57:33]  kaeos: why dont you just buy raw fish and eat it with rice
[05:57:35]  kirosthegreat: That's infuriating because I would 100% prefer tuna to avocado...
[05:57:51]  haine_sense1: hey could someone conveniently get me breakfast so I don't have to make myself get it?
[05:58:00]  kaeos: i do
[05:58:21]  robertzarmy: i invented sushi
[05:58:21]  kirosthegreat: @Haine_Sense1 paypal me 30,000 USD and you got a deal
[05:58:33]  haine_sense1: @KirosTheGreat damn, I don't have that much money
[05:58:47]  kaeos: mix it with WHAT
[05:58:51]  kirosthegreat: yuniiSad
[05:59:03]  kaeos: vinegar in rice DansGame
[05:59:06]  haine_sense1: wait, what is my sub badge atm?
[05:59:24]  robertzarmy: I also think real ramen is super good
[05:59:28]  303devilfish: the code geass helmet i think
[05:59:52]  kaeos: i love maruchan instant ramen
[05:59:59]  haine_sense1: oh, it might be
[06:00:01]  haine_sense1: interesting
[06:00:01]  kaeos: im a true appreciator of japanese cuisine
[06:00:11]  haine_sense1: been too long since I saw that
[06:00:23]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice. But if you want to help support the channel, and more importantly, help your boy get paid, feel free to click the link. Please give me your money. https://streamlabs.com/ktrzetto/tip https://www.twitch.tv/products/ktrZetto
[06:01:34]  303devilfish: Maruchan yakisoba is cheap as shit but tastes really good
[06:01:38]  kaeos: yeah
[06:01:46]  kaeos: i like to snort their msg flavoring packets
[06:02:11]  kirosthegreat: Yeah, like you can get 1 serving of instant ramen for like 35 cents if you get the bricks, or like 1 dollar a piece if you get the cups
[06:02:53]  kaeos: monosodium glutamate
[06:02:58]  robertzarmy: Monosodium glutamate
[06:02:58]  303devilfish: monosodium glutamate
[06:03:03]  kirosthegreat: msg is like a salt but it adds savory flavor
[06:03:09]  303devilfish: Monosodium glutamate (MSG), also known as sodium glutamate, is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. MSG is found naturally in some foods including tomatoes and cheese in this glutamic acid form.[2][3] MSG is used in cooking as a flavor enhancer with an umami taste that intensifies the meaty, savory flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups
[06:03:17]  kaeos: its not bad

[06:03:24]  kaeos: that's just lingering stigma
[06:04:49]  303devilfish: Some doctor wrote about "chinese restaurant syndrome" in the 60's and baselessly speculated it was caused by MSG.
[06:04:49]  kirosthegreat: Bruh just read what I wrote LUL
[06:05:20]  303devilfish: and it's just stuck around for decades
[06:05:29]  kaeos: 11.3
[06:05:39]  robertzarmy: 6.4
[06:05:41]  robertzarmy: fuck
[06:06:31]  robertzarmy: wowww zetto will talk about vaccines but won't listen to the video I sent him
[06:06:53]  haine_sense1: we're not gonna hear about it in 2080, we're gonna be dead in 2080
[06:07:00]  303devilfish: the amount of damage the antivax dude did with his bullshit paper is honestly staggering
[06:07:00]  kaeos: not me
[06:07:17]  robertzarmy: your mental gymnastics are astounding zetto
[06:07:35]  kaeos: wait are you anti vax
[06:08:11]  robertzarmy: who
[06:08:24]  kaeos: you
[06:08:34]  robertzarmy: no i just want zetto to listen to the song i sent him
[06:08:39]  haine_sense1: oh, sorry, I guess I meant I'll be dead in 2080
[06:08:52]  kaeos: that's the spirit
[06:09:07]  kirosthegreat: 60 years from now? If you're fortunate you'll be above the average age of death, but there's just as much of a chance that you fall below it, so idk if we're gonna make it to our 80s ...
[06:09:50]  kaeos: washed
[06:10:23]  robertzarmy: CAUSE IT IS STREAM SAFE
[06:10:26]  kaeos: LULW cucked by laura
[06:10:28]  robertzarmy: laura is a little baby
[06:10:41]  kaeos: ill listen to it and tell u my opinion
[06:11:10]  robertzarmy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO5eLAK9snI
[06:11:27]  haine_sense1: I was just saying it based on the feeling that I won't want to be alive that long
[06:11:55]  kaeos: KKonaJam
[06:12:32]  darkphoeen1x: Early
[06:13:06]  robertzarmy: that would be a fire shirt "I skipped my ff14 daily roulette for this"
[06:13:06]  darkphoeen1x: how dare you! jk i skip it most of the time on my main
[06:13:19]  303devilfish: is this song ironic
[06:13:23]  303devilfish: please tell me it is
[06:13:26]  robertzarmy: the song is not ironic
[06:13:44]  kaeos: i dont think this song is stream safe
[06:14:11]  robertzarmy: you have as much credibility as me kaeos
[06:14:33]  darkphoeen1x: i need a bag for school where it stands i skipped my FFXIV daily roulette for this
[06:14:37]  303devilfish: i'm leveling machinist rn HYPERS
[06:14:42]  kirosthegreat: Song is technically stream safe, but it would easily be considered deliberate misinformation.
[06:15:13]  darkphoeen1x: i need it now
[06:15:37]  darkphoeen1x: i don't even have a highschool
[06:15:45]  haine_sense1: wtaf is this song?
[06:15:46]  kaeos: i hated high school because you would wear an outfit from 2 weeks ago and someone would be like "didnt you already wear that"
[06:16:01]  robertzarmy: I never once had that happen to me
[06:16:21]  303devilfish: my high school only had like 400 students, it was pretty chill
[06:16:39]  kirosthegreat: Yep
[06:16:58]  robertzarmy: this is confirmation bias
[06:17:33]  kaeos: that would imply nobody noticed robert and that simply cannot be true
[06:17:42]  haine_sense1: best lyric in that song: "They got no scientific evidence to back that crap up"
[06:17:42]  kirosthegreat: Dude actually just seeing that he doesn't want to comply because he doesn't wanna wear a mask and somehow thinks science isn't science Jebaited
[06:17:48]  robertzarmy: @kaeos I guess if you wear uniforms it's true
[06:17:48]  haine_sense1: like cmon, it's literally based on science
[06:17:58]  kirosthegreat: Singing* I need some sleep soon.
[06:18:16]  darkphoeen1x: i'm on a school where it goes from grade 5 to 10 and i'm soon in grade 10 so my last year of school
[06:18:21]  kirosthegreat: Still in the red Kappa

[06:29:41]  robertzarmy: this is ridiculous
[06:29:44]  kaeos: i cant believe robert would try to indoctrinate the people in this chat
[06:29:45]  robertzarmy: I'm leaving
[06:30:26]  laurabraus: @kaeos im glad i missed it then
[06:30:36]  laurabraus: especially if it was requested by rob

[06:33:56]  haine_sense1: it's identify the music ‚Äî it's generally somewhat well known music
[06:34:23]  fredmanftw: Is it? what would u recommend instead
[06:34:29]  kaeos: i give up on heardle already
[06:34:56]  303devilfish: the duolingo owl threatened to stab me if i didn't do my daily exercises monkaS

[06:40:04]  robertzarmy: how fast do you think you could crab walk a marathon
[06:40:25]  kaeos: if you were allowed to use a car how fast do you think you could run a marathon
[06:41:01]  laurabraus: crab walk is when you walk on all fours but stomach side up
[06:41:03]  haine_sense1: how fast do you think you could complete a marathon distance if you could use any method of transportation available to you
[06:41:48]  kaeos: I think you would go slow because your mass of hair would increase you drag in the wind so much
[06:42:03]  robertzarmy: lmaoo
[06:42:16]  laurabraus: i guess ass side down is more accurate. like you're trying to keep your ass off the ground on all fours
[06:42:30]  robertzarmy: bowl cut hair
[06:42:44]  haine_sense1: hm... sounds like there's some fireworks display at a May Ball in some other college
[06:42:59]  laurabraus: i took gymnastics for a short time as a kid and we always had to crab walk
[06:43:07]  kaeos: literal fine china
[06:43:16]  laurabraus: then they wanted me to flip on one of those bars and i was like no way. goodbye
[06:43:27]  haine_sense1: @laurabraus the beam?
[06:43:39]  haine_sense1: uneven bars?
[06:44:05]  laurabraus: it wasn't the balance beam, it was those double bars where you grab on. usually in adult sports theres two of them they alternate on
[06:44:09]  laurabraus: YEAH uneven bars
[06:44:29]  laurabraus: as a kid though they just have you practice on one small one
[06:44:55]  haine_sense1: hi, I'm the guy who did flipping a vault off the arm of my sofa as a kid when I saw it on tv and my parents took me to gymnastics classes after that lol
[06:45:18]  robertzarmy: you're so awesome wow
[06:45:24]  laurabraus: yeah i was never that kid my mom as just trying out everything with me
[06:45:30]  kaeos: is that how you introduce yourself in icebreaker group activities
[06:45:32]  haine_sense1: and then I stopped doing gymnastics because I hated performing in front of everyone
[06:45:41]  laurabraus: was* but i mean i'm glad she did!!! i tried a lot!! and now im a gamer.
[06:45:46]  robertzarmy: I was forced into karate for 5 years and quit as soon as I was allowed

[06:46:50]  laurabraus: wtf hes a black belt
[06:46:52]  robertzarmy: how do you feel about kids being forced into religion
[06:47:00]  robertzarmy: by their parents
[06:47:20]  haine_sense1: depends how much force there is
[06:47:40]  laurabraus: yeah the extensive list of classes i tried as a kid is sad. ballet. tap. jazz. karate. gymnastics. didnt like any of that
[06:47:40]  kaeos: Sadge streamer is not based
[06:47:55]  haine_sense1: hm... interesting

[06:49:06]  laurabraus: so no ball sports
[06:49:09]  kaeos: just get laser eye surgery
[06:49:14]  robertzarmy: @laurabraus ü§ì
[06:49:14]  haine_sense1: @kaeos it's easy to get into, but at some point you have to work to get better
[06:49:15]  laurabraus: HELL no
[06:49:22]  haine_sense1: oh I see
[06:49:41]  kaeos: tennis is just big ping pong
[06:49:42]  kaeos: ??
[06:50:20]  laurabraus: i did do cheerleading in high school for a year does that count as anything
[06:50:28]  kaeos: thoughts on the lgtv community?
[06:50:49]  haine_sense1: I wanna try to serve again
[06:50:49]  laurabraus: i think tennis would have been really fun. it's even fun to watch
[06:50:50]  babsmcnh: Tennis is fun

[06:52:51]  babsmcnh: I tried cooking man
[06:52:53]  haine_sense1: the transition between casual play and proper training is super big in tennis
[06:52:55]  kaeos: you pussied out OMEGALUL
[06:53:10]  laurabraus: what a MOOD
[06:53:19]  kaeos: that's funny asf

[06:53:27]  robertzarmy: rank 1
[06:53:55]  haine_sense1: it was much less concerning in badminton for me, but I still never really got very far and ended up playing against people who were like 3 years younger than me which was kinda depressing
[06:54:12]  kaeos: with that story now I know why u won't accept a race to first sub 5 mile
[06:54:43]  robertzarmy: running a marathon is basically just like speedrunning
[06:54:51]  kaeos: true
[06:54:52]  laurabraus: @babsmcnh what did you try cooking
[06:55:04]  babsmcnh: Borger

[06:55:44]  303devilfish: go lift weight, it's fun :)
[06:55:51]  haine_sense1: over the course of like 12 years
[06:55:51]  robertzarmy: @babsmcnh you are dumb
[06:56:02]  babsmcnh: @kaeos it‚Äôs just a pork burger with some apple shredded in
[06:56:13]  babsmcnh: Not worth the fucking burn
[06:56:20]  babsmcnh: @robertzarmy I am intelligent
[06:56:24]  robertzarmy: how bad was the burn
[06:56:27]  babsmcnh: I couldn‚Äôt find my oven mitts
[06:56:38]  haine_sense1: wow this fireworks display is loud

[06:58:07]  kaeos: I've never heard of that
[06:58:15]  babsmcnh: I KNOW KAEOS
[06:58:20]  babsmcnh: I‚Äôve never don‚Äôt it before
[06:58:33]  babsmcnh: I think I tried grabbing it too much before lifting it
[06:58:41]  babsmcnh: And the heat accumulated
[06:58:52]  babsmcnh: I put the burger in the oven @ktrzetto
[06:58:59]  haine_sense1: reminder in Britain, the burger refers to the patty
[06:59:05]  babsmcnh: Usually people put it on a pan
[06:59:15]  kaeos: @haine_sense1 OHHHHHHH
[06:59:17]  babsmcnh: Raw
[06:59:20]  kaeos: that makes more sense
[06:59:26]  babsmcnh: Yeah sorry lol
[06:59:32]  kaeos: British "cuisine"
[06:59:45]  babsmcnh: I meant the patty I guess I messed up on the explanation lol
[06:59:47]  haine_sense1: I came across this when in another chat
[07:00:01]  babsmcnh: I didn‚Äôt realize that was an issue
[07:00:05]  robertzarmy: I did not confuse this yall are just dumb
[07:00:12]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL I‚Äôm not that stupid
[07:00:18]  nightbot: You probably shouldn't give any streamer money. I'm not a financial advisor but that is financial advice.

[07:03:06]  robertzarmy: but yeah the inspect from clintcord
[07:03:17]  babsmcnh: Lol 9 years
[07:03:24]  babsmcnh: You mean like 6 months?
[07:03:42]  haine_sense1: there are too many definitions of summer
[07:03:45]  kaeos: 14-9 ü§î
[07:03:56]  robertzarmy: I escaped from clintcord
[07:03:59]  robertzarmy: thank god

[07:04:12]  babsmcnh: Lol do not hang out on discord
[07:04:20]  babsmcnh: It‚Äôs not good LUL
[07:04:25]  kaeos: I don't use discord and I don't trust discord friendships
[07:04:38]  babsmcnh: I‚Äôm the exact same zetto
[07:04:49]  robertzarmy: most people on discord are strange and weird
[07:04:50]  babsmcnh: I talk to you more than them tbh
[07:04:52]  kaeos: I actually had a dream about the exact same thing the other night
[07:04:57]  robertzarmy: there are a couple normal humans sometimes
[07:05:01]  kaeos: where everyone I distanced from had changed
[07:05:03]  babsmcnh: Not the best idea but they‚Äôre always busy as well
[07:05:04]  haine_sense1: I mean, discord has a *lot* of bad things on it, but it also has a lot of good things. and I find that small communities on discord are often ok.
[07:05:23]  robertzarmy: ok bye
[07:05:31]  babsmcnh: Yeah i agree with haine
[07:05:31]  haine_sense1: while large communities are like, generally bad
[07:05:34]  babsmcnh: See yaaaa
[07:05:43]  haine_sense1: byeeee
[07:05:45]  kaeos: discord is just furries and weebs
[07:05:51]  babsmcnh: Clintcord isn‚Äôt too bad but it can be very cliquey
[07:06:11]  babsmcnh: And it gets a little intense monkaS
[07:06:14]  haine_sense1: @kaeos my year group of maths at uni has a discord server
[07:06:42]  haine_sense1: I don't think that's furries
[07:06:46]  babsmcnh: LUL
[07:06:48]  haine_sense1: might contain weebs
[07:06:54]  haine_sense1: but not in it's entirety
[07:06:54]  kaeos: I've had discord groups for college classes too but if they use discord in the first place I assume they're furries and weebs
[07:07:21]  haine_sense1: oh, so you're saying that discord is just furries and weeds because you assume everyone is
[07:07:21]  babsmcnh: I‚Äôve tried to use discord with friends and it‚Äôs just awkward as shit most of them don‚Äôt know how to use it
[07:07:23]  haine_sense1: got it
[07:07:29]  kaeos: ye
[07:07:30] rinta_rnt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months!
[07:08:00]  babsmcnh: I‚Äôve been bombarded with 5 ads ‚ò†Ô∏è
[07:08:03]  rinta_rnt: 5ÈÄ£Âã§„ÇÅÊòéÊó•„Åæ„Åß
[07:08:05]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh yea, I've noticed that only really people who are already sufficiently computationally able seem to be capable of using it
[07:08:07]  kaeos: NERDS OMEGALUL
[07:08:22]  babsmcnh: Exactly haine LUL
[07:08:49]  babsmcnh: Also discord can get weird sometimes so idk how much you‚Äôd want to be there constantly
[07:08:52]  kaeos: not me :)
[07:08:57]  haine_sense1: which is weird since I'd kinda assume everyone is like capable since it doesn't feel hard to use
[07:09:11]  babsmcnh: ‚ÄúNerds‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs like my stream‚Äù - zetto, 2022
[07:09:37]  kaeos: not me :)
[07:09:51]  babsmcnh: EXCUSE ME ?!
[07:10:03]  haine_sense1: I'm not gonna say I'm not a nerd, but I will dispute that being the reason I watch it
[07:10:06]  babsmcnh: I‚Äôm not a nerd ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì
[07:10:24]  babsmcnh: XQC LUL
[07:10:37]  303devilfish: Sadge
[07:10:42]  babsmcnh: Do you think I‚Äôm parasocial PauseChamp
[07:10:42]  haine_sense1: CAN CONFIRM
[07:10:49]  babsmcnh: Wait I don‚Äôt dream that lol
[07:10:52]  kaeos: Stay mad nerd. I go outside, have tons of sex, make money, and my life is very interesting.
[07:10:53]  haine_sense1: THERE IS NO CHANCE
[07:10:59]  babsmcnh: You just seem funny to chat to
[07:11:14]  babsmcnh: @kaeos EZ Clap
[07:11:32]  babsmcnh: Look I AM A DEGEN but I am not parasocial
[07:11:58]  babsmcnh: Idk I don‚Äôt rly know the definition of parasocial
[07:12:20]  babsmcnh: Ahhhh
[07:12:25]  haine_sense1: oh yea, I totally know everything about you
[07:12:41]  kaeos: monkaW
[07:12:50]  babsmcnh: I know zetto isn‚Äôt the best at sm64 PepeLaugh
[07:12:57]  haine_sense1: I could even tell you where you live
[07:13:02]  haine_sense1: and I'd be right
[07:13:10]  kaeos: monkaGIGA
[07:13:10]  haine_sense1: because I'd be sufficiently imprecise
[07:13:38]  babsmcnh: Yeah I think the closest I am to being parasocial is in Clint‚Äôs chat but I think it‚Äôs just cuz I watch his YT vids
[07:14:00]  babsmcnh: And I don‚Äôt try to be friends with him, why would I when I can chill out with you guys EZ
[07:14:16]  kaeos: xqc will notice me COPIUM
[07:14:30]  babsmcnh: LUL kaeos
[07:14:54]  babsmcnh: Yeah true but there‚Äôs a limit to the parasocial activity where it‚Äôs the persons fault
[07:15:08]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL DREAMS CHAT
[07:15:15]  haine_sense1: HAHAHA
[07:15:20]  kaeos: those people are the most toxic dudes too
[07:15:29]  haine_sense1: I've never been there but I can imagine
[07:15:39]  babsmcnh: way too toxic, I‚Äôd be terrified having a community like that
[07:16:08]  haine_sense1: WHY IS MY FREAKING STREAM VIDEO DYING SO MUCJ
[07:16:14]  babsmcnh: Sadge Haine
[07:16:22]  haine_sense1: IT'S HAPPENED 4 TIMES THIS STREAM

[07:16:40]  kaeos: it loads fine on my phone but not my PC weirdly enough
[07:16:56]  babsmcnh: Exclusive
[07:17:03]  babsmcnh: I think that‚Äôs what you mean
[07:17:05]  haine_sense1: it's fine, just the video sometimes decides to freeze and then after a while, the audio cuts out too
[07:17:18]  kaeos: one guyd Sadge
[07:17:37]  babsmcnh: I hate when that happens, thats why I‚Äôm welcoming to new chatters
[07:18:07]  babsmcnh: To you it might just be chilling with the homies saying jokes but to the person on the outside you look like a dick
[07:18:13]  haine_sense1: yea, it won't be you, I've been having similar problems with streams for a while now
[07:18:20]  babsmcnh: Not like YOU zetto, like a general ‚Äúyou‚Äù

[07:20:19]  kaeos: I thought of it bc why do British people eat the physical representation of the color grey but other places find that abhorrent
[07:20:39]  haine_sense1: @kaeos what are you referring to there?
[07:20:46]  buttershooter_: babs peepoHug hope you are doing well aswell
[07:21:04]  kaeos: idk I just think of british food as like beans and toast
[07:21:11]  kaeos: and military rations
[07:21:14]  haine_sense1: oh lol
[07:21:16]  haine_sense1: fair
[07:21:18]  babsmcnh: I‚Äôve seen a couple that just go into chat and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúwho else would slurp on Clint‚Äôs joycon üòç‚Äù
[07:21:27]  buttershooter_: @babsmcnh monkaW
[07:21:32]  haine_sense1: hey da
[07:21:33]  haine_sense1: dad
[07:21:36]  babsmcnh: I thought it was a joke but I tried to talk to them more they were being serious
[07:21:38]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL
[07:21:41]  kaeos: ok dad üòè
[07:22:08]  babsmcnh: LUL they did that?
[07:22:20]  babsmcnh: Oh yeah I forgot he streamed yesterday
[07:22:51]  babsmcnh: Other than that I‚Äôm pretty welcoming to people
[07:22:57]  haine_sense1: I feel like I am definitely par asocial with people to some extent, but I would never go THAT far, like holy shit
[07:22:59]  kaeos: mommy? üò≥
[07:23:11]  haine_sense1: parasocial*
[07:23:29]  kippykat4774: takes time for you to grow huh
[07:23:32]  kippykat4774: so not a shower?
[07:23:36]  kippykat4774: just a grower
[07:23:36]  haine_sense1: lol
[07:23:38]  kaeos: good one LULW
[07:23:43]  babsmcnh: I just don‚Äôt want to see someone join the chat to try to date Clint - like he isn‚Äôt even in chat and it‚Äôs very stalker-like to go into their offline and wait for them to join to flirt with em
[07:24:01]  kippykat4774: hell yeahh
[07:24:03]  babsmcnh: Yeah Haine I don‚Äôt think anyone is that bad here
[07:24:05]  kippykat4774: $1,600
[07:24:12]  kaeos: I started watching this stream bc zetto responded to a question I was asking in Clint's offline chat
[07:24:24]  babsmcnh: Pog what a journey
[07:24:28]  kippykat4774: who would want to flirt with a guy named 1 letter off from clit
[07:24:29]  kippykat4774: Kappa
[07:24:45]  babsmcnh: I started watching zetto when he begged me to watch his streams
[07:24:56]  kaeos: DESPERATE STREAMER LULW
[07:24:57]  babsmcnh: I KNOW ITS NUTS LUL
[07:24:59]  haine_sense1: lol
[07:25:35]  babsmcnh: I think I‚Äôve only ‚Äúchatted‚Äù with him once and it was for two seconds idk what people expect when they say weird shit to him
[07:26:19]  haine_sense1: almost lol
[07:26:26]  kaeos: I've chatted with Clint when he responded to my question what time zone he was in at 4am est 3 years ago
[07:26:30]  babsmcnh: OMEGALUL
[07:26:31]  kaeos: we're tight like that
[07:26:46]  babsmcnh: POGGERS kaeos is so cool
[07:26:47]  haine_sense1: super tight
[07:27:01]  babsmcnh: I just like chatting to offline or clintcord
[07:27:23]  babsmcnh: It‚Äôs relaxing and I just get to say whatever and make sure everyone‚Äôs doing alright
[07:28:07]  babsmcnh: I know a lot of people use the internet cuz they feel alone irl so it‚Äôs good for people to know they‚Äôre not alone HYPERS
[07:28:12]  kaeos: "Yeah." - ktrZetto
[07:28:22]  babsmcnh: Some people are dicks though lol
[07:28:49]  haine_sense1: @babsmcnh hi, totally not me ;)
[07:28:52]  babsmcnh: Tbh I burnout so easily irl but online i just talk shit
[07:29:03]  babsmcnh: Of course not Haine! peepoHug
[07:29:08]  kaeos: same
[07:29:37]  babsmcnh: I just meant some people from Clint‚Äôs chat - mainly people who are cliquey and they say mean things when they don‚Äôt actually mean it
[07:29:48]  haine_sense1: are there any regulars here that you wish didn't come by?
[07:29:59]  babsmcnh: I think that‚Äôs my main worry if I ever streamed zetto
[07:30:12]  kaeos: I hung out in Clint's offline chat for a few months and left because it felt cliquey
[07:30:22]  babsmcnh: One of my friends started streaming and holy fuck the main viewer was a piece of shit
[07:30:46]  haine_sense1: most efficient reds ever
[07:31:02]  babsmcnh: @haine_sense1 I doubt he‚Äôd say if they‚Äôre regulars lol but probably just the starfy guy
[07:31:18]  haine_sense1: I didn't mean to ask for specifics
[07:31:21]  haine_sense1: just if there were any
[07:31:23]  babsmcnh: @kaeos it took a long fucking time for me to integrate into the chat
[07:31:46]  babsmcnh: A lot of ‚Äúfuck you‚Äùs thrown around Sadge but I think I‚Äôm comfy in their now
[07:32:00]  babsmcnh: I get why you wouldn‚Äôt stick to offline though
[07:32:06]  kaeos: well most people are nice but some people i just didnt want to make the effort to get "in"
[07:32:09]  babsmcnh: Ohhhh haine
[07:32:14]  curryinthehouse: Heyo, it's every viewer you don't liike here
[07:32:15]  haine_sense1: I mean, you can
[07:32:16]  curryinthehouse: GL
[07:32:26]  babsmcnh: Ey it‚Äôs curry Pog
[07:32:34]  curryinthehouse: KonCha
[07:32:44]  babsmcnh: I remember watching you dude you‚Äôre funny as fuck man
[07:32:50]  curryinthehouse: They've been shit :D
[07:33:12]  curryinthehouse: Same
[07:33:19]  babsmcnh: @kaeos I understand that a lot tbh
[07:33:19]  curryinthehouse: I've been grinding out sblj and I wanna die
[07:33:20]  curryinthehouse: in game
[07:33:44]  haine_sense1: I think it helps if you can start with like a viewer
[07:33:50]  curryinthehouse: Just get 1 PB and be done with it tbh
[07:33:55]  curryinthehouse: @babsmcnh Thanks lol
[07:34:10]  babsmcnh: You‚Äôre doing great zetto tbh you aren‚Äôt that far behind ur pb
[07:34:40]  haine_sense1: you're doing fine
[07:34:44]  babsmcnh: @haine_sense1 I think it might be easier to stream if you‚Äôre known in an offline chat
[07:34:55]  babsmcnh: Cuz then you know some of ur offline friends will watch you
[07:34:59]  curryinthehouse: I used to chat in other people's streams a lot
[07:35:08]  curryinthehouse: harder to do nowadays, more responsibilities and whatnot
[07:35:23]  babsmcnh: Idk compared to my friend who just randomly streamed outta nowhere it was a rough start
[07:35:36]  babsmcnh: Pog
[07:35:39]  curryinthehouse: @babsmcnh Really depends on the game you're playing tbh
[07:35:46]  babsmcnh: CASUAL PLAYTHROUGH POGGERS
[07:35:52]  curryinthehouse: SM64 is niche enough where if you can prove you're good enough you can get a following
[07:35:58]  curryinthehouse: Variety streamers are giga boned
[07:36:00]  babsmcnh: True curry
[07:36:19]  haine_sense1: I am thinking of streaming maybe at some point soon
[07:36:25]  babsmcnh: POGGERS ALREADY REDDDD
[07:36:37]  haine_sense1: I'm going to get no viewers since it's in a game that no one knows
[07:36:51]  babsmcnh: Try it maybe you‚Äôll enjoy it @haine_sense1 but just be wary of shitty people
[07:37:11]  babsmcnh: It‚Äôs kinda nuts how common they are when people start off streaming lol
[07:37:34]  haine_sense1: I'd be like top 25% immediately
[07:37:41]  haine_sense1: since no one streams that game
[07:37:53]  haine_sense1: if someone watched me
[07:37:56]  babsmcnh: EZ Clap capturing the market lets go
[07:38:49]  babsmcnh: This might still be the run COPIUM
[07:39:09]  kaeos: big booty puerto rican goddess
[07:39:10]  haine_sense1: but yea, if you wanna see someone play a weird 2D platformmer from 1994 not very well, then come watch me if I eventually convince myself to go live
[07:39:27]  babsmcnh: @kaeos think you meant to type that on pornhub LUL
[07:39:31]  babsmcnh: jk jk
[07:39:32]  curryinthehouse: I streamed for 4 months to 1 viewer, 2 viewers tops
[07:39:38]  curryinthehouse: and the 1 viewer was mysself
[07:39:45]  curryinthehouse: March-July of 2020
[07:39:48]  curryinthehouse: Wild times those were
[07:39:55]  curryinthehouse: I had a personality back then
[07:40:01]  babsmcnh: PepeHands
[07:40:21]  curryinthehouse: I definitely do now OMEGALUL
[07:40:30]  curryinthehouse: I fell off streaming pretty hard since january
[07:40:35]  kaeos: + L
[07:40:37]  curryinthehouse: Trying to get back into it now
[07:40:38]  babsmcnh: I think I‚Äôll just stick to being a dumb chatter rn HYPERS
[07:41:05]  babsmcnh: Maybe one day I‚Äôll stream but just chilling out in a chat is fine and I don‚Äôt feel weird when no one responds to shit
[07:41:32]  kaeos: i would stream if mixer offered me a multi million dollar deal
[07:41:37]  babsmcnh: You retained a good amount of viewers
[07:42:01]  babsmcnh: LUL kaeos
[07:42:13]  babsmcnh: Zetto right now you have 20K viewers EZ
[07:42:18]  babsmcnh: they‚Äôre just very shy
[07:42:24]  haine_sense1: oh, the stream froze again for me
[07:42:32]  haine_sense1: might use this as an oppor
[07:42:38]  haine_sense1: opportunity to get food
[07:42:46]  babsmcnh: Terps is well known
[07:43:04]  babsmcnh: Zetto do I have clout
[07:43:06]  laurabraus: im back
[07:43:18]  babsmcnh: How the fuck do people get clout
[07:43:20]  curryinthehouse: If you want to become a big streamer, you have to network *hard* both inside and outside your niche
[07:43:28]  curryinthehouse: Emily and Squeex do that
[07:43:28]  babsmcnh: LAURA BACK HYPERS
[07:43:44]  kaeos: i feel like discoverability is bad so just be in as many chats as possible is the strat
[07:43:50]  babsmcnh: Yeah @curryinthehouse I would hate social networking
[07:44:04]  curryinthehouse: @kaeos That and play games that have communities you can be an active participant in
[07:44:11]  curryinthehouse: That's why speedrunning viewers are so loyal
[07:44:30]  babsmcnh: Wait a sec
[07:44:37]  babsmcnh: TWO GOLDS POGGERS
[07:44:50]  haine_sense1: I'll be back when I've got food
[07:44:50]  babsmcnh: I just noticed it lol zetto is making a comeback Prayge
[07:44:59]  babsmcnh: See ya haine
[07:45:11]  haine_sense1: I need to make myself get food since I haven't done all day
[07:45:41]  curryinthehouse: It's actually far easier to create yt content and bring viewers over from yt to twitch as a result
[07:45:44]  babsmcnh: How do you make friends Sadge
[07:45:48]  kaeos: yeah get a feature on clints stream
[07:46:03]  curryinthehouse: Well I don't hang out with anyone EZ
[07:46:12]  curryinthehouse: (I am busy with work Sadge)
[07:46:13]  babsmcnh: I feel like I‚Äôm approachable but idk how many people think of me as someone noticeable I guess
[07:46:30]  babsmcnh: Just another chatter PepePls
[07:46:50]  curryinthehouse: I think people kinda remember me cuz of my name
[07:47:00]  curryinthehouse: It's either steph curry or food
[07:47:20]  babsmcnh: I‚Äôd probably just avoid streaming with people, there‚Äôd probably be stupid ass drama or some shit
[07:47:39]  babsmcnh: Same curry people DEF remember me cuz of my name too Kappa
[07:47:52]  curryinthehouse: I actually love streaming with other people, I really miss streaming VCs while we were all grinding mario
[07:47:52]  babsmcnh: Ur name is good though @curryinthehouse
[07:48:07]  kaeos: i remember you now but when i first saw you i thought you were a minecraft stan
[07:48:18]  babsmcnh: I think that‚Äôs how I know you curry - from kally
[07:48:28]  babsmcnh: Or his new name monkaHmm I forget it
[07:48:33]  curryinthehouse: Yeah Kally is the reason I play the game at all
[07:48:42]  curryinthehouse: First person in the community to reach out to me and teach me how to play
[07:48:54]  babsmcnh: You and momomoth were chill when I watched kally
[07:49:04]  babsmcnh: Aw that‚Äôs really nice of him
[07:49:20]  curryinthehouse: Kally's less of a content streamer and more of a game streamer
[07:49:32]  babsmcnh: @kaeos wait you thought I was a minecraft Stan?
[07:49:42]  kaeos: yeah
[07:49:44]  babsmcnh: FeelsWeirdMan maybe I should rename myself wtf
[07:49:47]  kaeos: when i see mc thats what i think
[07:49:55]  curryinthehouse: I met most of the people I talk to through Simply's community
[07:49:57]  curryinthehouse: and Xoofey

[07:50:53]  babsmcnh: bro I look like a 10 year old in every chat then Sadge
[07:51:06]  babsmcnh: There is much more purpose to my name
[07:51:12]  curryinthehouse: Yeah babs I thought your name was a mix of tiny toon adventures, minecraft and animal crossing
[07:51:21]  babsmcnh: I hate my life.
[07:51:24]  curryinthehouse: OMEGALUL
[07:51:35]  laurabraus: i always read the end of babs name like McNH with the "nh" sounding like "ngh" like a groan LMAO
[07:51:38]  kaeos: its fine my name is like an edgelord and thats worse imo
[07:51:44]  babsmcnh: It was my webkinz name

[07:52:46]  babsmcnh: I got stressed when I was 8 about finding a username
[07:52:58]  babsmcnh: So I got stressed and banged my head against my keyboard
[07:53:17]  curryinthehouse: I figured out my username while on the coryinthehouse subreddit in 2016
[07:53:21]  babsmcnh: I think it‚Äôs pretty good brand wise cuz I freak out on shit
[07:53:27]  curryinthehouse: My old name was curryisspicey
